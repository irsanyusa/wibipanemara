The actor then got his break into the international arena when he was cast as Tony Manero in the 1977 film <i>Saturday Night Fever</i>. The movie followed Tony, a paint store clerk who joins a dancing competition and convinces the beautiful Stephanie (Karen Lynn) to be his dance partner. As the pair trains for the competition, they begin to fall for each other. Travolta was nominated for various awards for his role in the movie.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/3782d2abb9f0e66f.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Danny Miller bio: age, height, siblings, who is he dating?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>After the box office success of <i>Saturday Night Fever</i>, John was named in the cast for the 1978 movie musical <i>Grease</i>. The film followed two teenagers, Danny and Sandy who fall in love during summer vacation. Travolta played the role of Danny. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The film</a> was very successful due to its massive audience. The movie raked in around $400 million and had a $6 million production budget. With those figures, <i>Grease</i> became one of the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">highest-grossing action movie musicals</a>.</p><p></p><p class=align-left>After his run of successful projects, Travolta’s acting career began to decline with a series of unpopular films. Top among the poor-performing was the <i>Saturday Night Fever</i> 1983 sequel <i>Staying Alive</i>. This was followed by the equally poor <i>Two of a Kind</i> (1983) and <i>Perfect</i> (1985). The actor enjoyed brief success with the <i>Look Who’s Talking</i> series alongside Kirstie Alley. However, by the end of the 1980s, Travolta was in the ‘has-been’ category of actors.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/a634b2868691e62b.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Jeff Conaway: Most exciting details about the Grease star</span></p></a><p class=align-left>After a significant decline in his acting career, John made an epic comeback in 1994 when he starred in the film <i><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Pulp Fiction</a></i>. The movie was directed by Quentin Tarantino and followed two hit men, Jules Winnfield (Samuel L Jackson) and Vincent Vega (Travolta). The film earned Travolta an Academy Award nomination. A scene where he dances with Uma Thurman is also on the list of the favourite film scenes of all time. After <i>Pulp Fiction</i>, John was back on the acting limelight.</p><p></p><p class=align-left>In 1995, the actor played the character Chill in the comedy <i>Get Shorty</i>. His performance in the novel-based movie won him a Golden Globe award. A sequel to Get Shorty was released in 2005 titled <i>Be Cool</i> but was not as successful as the first movie.</p><p class=align-left>Within the 90s decade, the actor appeared in films such as <i>Primary Colors</i> (1998), <i>Phenomenon </i>(1996) and <i>Arrow</i> (1996). John’s final film in the 90s was <i>The General’s Daughter</i> (1999). The beginning of the following decade was not very kind to the actor. His first movie of the decade <i>Battlefield Earth</i> (2000) was a massive miss. The film was based on a novel by Ron Hubbard, the Scientology founder. Despite the flop, the actor was back again, this time in the movie <i>Swordfish</i> (2001) alongside Hugh Jackman and Halle Berry. Other notable Travolta movies within that period included <i>Wild Hogs, Ladder 49 </i>and <i>Love Song for Bobby Long.</i></p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/282d9e895c046a94.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Tony Sirico bio: age, height, wife, net worth, movies and TV shows</span></p></a><p class=align-left>In 2007, the actor went back to his musical background in the movie adaptation of the Broadway hit <i>Hairspray</i>. The film tells the story of a plump young girl who wishes to perform in a local dance show. Travolta played the role of the girl’s mother (Edna). This was accomplished with the use of makeup, costumes, and wigs. The transformation of John into a large bubbly woman allowed him to showcase his vocal prowess in the film. Travolta’s performance in Hairspray earned him another Golden Globe nomination.</p><p class=align-left>In 2008, the actor was the voice of the lead role in Disney’s animated film <i>Bolt</i>. The movie revolves around a lost dog who believes that he has superpowers. He is accidentally shipped away into the mean streets of New York armed only with his superpower delusion and sets out to find his owner. John also performed the film’s ending credits duet with Miley Cyrus titled <i>I Thought I Lost You</i>. In 2009, John appeared in the comedy <i>Old Dogs</i> alongside Bernie Mac and Robin Williams.

There is barely any further information regarding the actor’s body size, shoe size or other measurements.</p><h2>Who are John Travolta kids?</h2><p class=align-left>Travolta met his wife Kelly Preston in 1987 while on set for the movie The Experts. However, the two did not start dating until 1990 after Kelly broke up with her husband. The couple dated for one and a half years and got married in 1990 in Paris. The Paris wedding ceremony was deemed unofficial since it was presided over by a Scientology minister. A week after the first wedding, the couple got married in Florida, this time in an official ceremony.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/8b9c739f84b47932.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Michael Gambon bio: age, height, net worth, movies and TV shows</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/0eccad4325f36972.jpg><p class=align-left>In 1992, the couple was blessed with a baby boy (Jett) who unfortunately passed away at age sixteen. In 2000, John Travolta daughter, Ella Bleu, was born. Ten years later, the couple welcomed a baby boy named Benjamin. Before their marriage, Travolta had been linked with various women throughout his career. These included:</p><ul><li><strong>Diana Hyland:</strong> Towards the end of 1976, Travolta began dating Diana after the two met while working on <i>The Boy in the Plastic Bubble</i>. Hyland was diagnosed with cancer and later passed away in the actor’s arms.</li><li><strong>Anita Gillette: </strong>The actor met Anita in 1978 while working on the play <i>Bus Stop</i> and the two got close.</li><li><strong>Catherine Deneuve:</strong> In 1980, John began dating Catherine, who was eleven years his senior.

In 2006, the actor was alleged to have kissed a male colleague before boarding his private plane in Canada. In 2012, two men intended to sue the actor for emotional distress and sexual battery. Travolta’s former pilot (Douglas Gotterba) also claimed that he and the actor were involved in a relationship in the 1980s.</p><p class=align-left>However, Travolta dismissed all these allegations in 2014 and claimed them to be made up by people who wanted money from him. He termed the gay rumours as ‘every actor’s Achilles heel’. Travolta’s attorney (Marty Singer) also dismissed the claims. He claimed that his client’s accusers were looking for their fifteen minutes of fame by fabricating stories about things that supposedly took place.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Billie Eilish bio: age, family, songs, style, boyfriend</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/647c4642065e539e.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>All you need to know about Jason Sudeikis</span></p></a><h2>John Travolta net worth</h2><p class=align-left>The actor’s <a id=https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/john-travoltas-net-worth-and-how-hes-still-making-moneyfrom-grease.html/ href=# rel="nofollow noopener">current net worth</a> is estimated to be $170 million.
