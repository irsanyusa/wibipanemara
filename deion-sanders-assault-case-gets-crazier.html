Today, Deion Sanders was also cited for misdemeanor assault in connection with the same altercation, the <a href=#>LA Times</a> reports.<span id=more-142269></span>While no details have been released about the allegations, the story drew national attention when Deion Sanders<a href=#> tweeted</a> yesterday that Pilar had attacked him. “Pray for me and my kids now! They just witnessed their mother and friend jump me in my room. She’s going to jail n I’m pressing charges!” the NFL Hall of Famer wrote. He also tweeted a picture (now deleted) of his boys filling out a police report.</p><p>(<strong>READ</strong>: <a href=#>Deion Sanders Estranged Wife Arrested for Assaulting Him</a>)</p><p>While Pilar was arrested and spent the night in jail, police said that investigation into the incident led to the charge against Sanders, although they indicated the charge did not warrant his arrest. A Prosper, Texas police spokesman told the <a href=#>LA Times</a> that the football star’s charge applies to any “aggressive” act, which can even be “as simple as a touch or jerking away from someone’s grip.” The charge carries a fine up to $500.</p><p>Deion and Pilar filed for divorce last December, but still lived in the same residence in Prosper, in separate wings. The marriage has had its share of theatrics: the couple starred in their own reality series on Oxygen in 2008 called Deion & Pilar: Prime Time Love. And the <a href=#>Associated Press</a> reports that Pilar is suing Deion Sanders and his daughter from his first marriage, as well as Prime Time Enterprise Inc., for $200 million in damages in a case scheduled for trial in September. She’s also suing Deion’s aunt, Laura Jones, saying Jones assaulted her in February in their home while Deion Sanders watched.</p><p>“I understand that I have very little chance at beating a Hall of Fame, two-sport man that everyone seems to love and adore,” ABC reports Pilar saying following her release from jail yesterday. “I’m a full-time mom, 100 percent for my children.&nbsp; And I just haven’t been given a fair shake.”</p><p><strong>MORE</strong>: <a href=#>NFLPA: Some Saints Players Could Face Criminal Charges Over Bounties</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAp7HEnWWtoZ2ae6S7zGhpaWliZH11e5FuZp2dmaS7br%2FAp5ueqqNirrS%2FwK6jrWWTlsCmecaeq6xlk6euu7XEq2Y%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./award-winning-hallets-cider-made-south-wales-valleys.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Hallets Cider | Pick of the crop</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./bethenny-frankel-lifetime-movie-danger-in-the-dorm-1235924579.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Bethenny Frankel Joins Lifetime Movie Danger in the Dorm (EXCLUSIVE)</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./joe-biden-immigration-private-prisons.html>Biden Use of Private Migrant Centers Grows Amid Border Surge</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-often-should-you-replace-your-shoes.html>How Often Should You Replace Your Shoes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1550102-james-bond-actors-order-how-played-iconic-spy.html>James Bond actors in order: how many played the iconic spy?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./0-28804-1898067-1938106-1938103-00-html.html>Jeff Han - TIME 100 Roundtables</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-cnsa-adopte-sa-convention-socle-avec-les-departements.html>La CNSA adopte sa convention socle avec les dpartements</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogZ.
