In every one of the 17 nations featured in our study, a majority of the public say experiencing products in-person is a key reason to shop in a brick-and-mortar store. This is at its highest in Mexico, where 7 in 10 consumers say this influences their reasons to shop at these stores (71%) – and even in France, where this tendency lowest, half of consumers (51%) say the same.</p><p paraeid={71ffa13b-66ae-4910-8b8b-ad4ac75f262d}{216} paraid=106527689>A significant proportion of global consumers also appreciate the speed and simplicity of an in-store buy. In Mexico (52%), Australia (52%), Spain (50%), and the US (50%), at least half of the public feel this way; German consumers, a quarter of whom (26%) say the pace of their purchase influences their decisions to use brick-and-mortar channels, are an outlier.</p><p paraeid={71ffa13b-66ae-4910-8b8b-ad4ac75f262d}{226} paraid=1536097846>There’s also evidence that the brick-and-mortar shopping experience is something a significant proportion of consumers value in and of itself. Approaching half of consumers in Hong Kong say that going to a retail store is a key motivation (46%), with nearly a quarter of Polish consumers saying the same at the other end of the scale (23%). There isn’t necessarily neat alignment from region to region. While Scandinavian nations might say that being able to try things in store is a key motivator (Denmark 64%; Sweden 63%), APAC nations are all over the scale: while three in five Australians (60%) and Indonesians (59%) say the same, this falls to two in five consumers in India (39%) and China (35%).</p><p paraeid={71ffa13b-66ae-4910-8b8b-ad4ac75f262d}{236} paraid=461487718>Similarly, European nations can be found at the top (Britain 42%; Germany 38%) in terms of whether the in-store experience is a key motivator, but also at the bottom (France 29%; Poland 23%). In Australia (40%) and Spain (36%), a product return policy is a key part of a brick-and-mortar chain’s appeal; in Italy (20%) and Hong Kong (19%), it plays a much smaller role.</p><p paraeid={71ffa13b-66ae-4910-8b8b-ad4ac75f262d}{250} paraid=305588332><strong>Barriers to buying through brick-and-mortar channels</strong></p><p paraeid={5b661edf-79a1-47b8-ad3b-ced6ca9db665}{1} paraid=551795099>So what stops consumers from buying through brick and mortar channels? As with the motivators, it varies heavily from market to market, although there are some regional commonalities. A lack of suitable offers and discounts, for example, is cited as a key barrier for consumers in most of the APAC countries in our survey: approaching half of the public in Indonesia (52%), India (47%), Singapore (46%), and China (45%) say it stops them shopping in physical stores. It’s less of a barrier in Scandinavia (Denmark 17%; Sweden 19%) and the US (21%). Offering more rewards for consumers who pop into the shop may nonetheless pay off in certain markets.</p><p paraeid={5b661edf-79a1-47b8-ad3b-ced6ca9db665}{19} paraid=1262619466>COVID has also played a significant role: a desire to adhere to social distancing guidelines or avoid public interactions has been an obstacle for between half (Great Britain: 48%), and a quarter (Poland: 25%) of consumers. As the global vaccine rollout continues and normality reasserts itself, this should be less of a barrier for consumers – again, in each market, a majority of consumers prefer experiencing products in-store.</p><p paraeid={5b661edf-79a1-47b8-ad3b-ced6ca9db665}{34} paraid=1752560776>Although looking at our list of barriers reveals they may also have an ambivalent relationship with it, particularly in the APAC region. Singapore (46%), China (43%), Hong Kong (39%) and Australia (33%) make up four of the top five countries where the public cite the inconvenience of going to a physical store as a problem when using brick-and-mortar channels.</p><p paraeid={5b661edf-79a1-47b8-ad3b-ced6ca9db665}{38} paraid=1469570093>This feeling may be exacerbated among the small – but often significant – group of consumers who say accessibility is a reason to avoid brick-and-mortar channels. In Singapore, this rises to as many as three in ten consumers (30%), and a fifth of consumers in India (22%), Mexico (22%), Poland (22%), Indonesia (19%), the UAE (19%), and Denmark (18%). On a related note, three in ten Australian (31%), Mexican (30%) Spanish (30%), Swedish (30%) Indian (29%) and Emirati (29%) consumers claim parking is a problem when it comes to physical retail. Improving ease of access for the public may not seem like a major sales driver, but it could make a difference to an important subset of the global population.</p><p paraeid={0a2da9ab-cf37-4fdf-9bf9-b0f64a0232b1}{184} paraid=906725396><strong>Receive monthly topical insights about the retail industry, straight to your inbox. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sign up today</a>.</strong></p><p paraeid={0a2da9ab-cf37-4fdf-9bf9-b0f64a0232b1}{193} paraid=1274890717><strong>Discover more <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">retail content </a>here</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtksLC60q6knqpflr%2B1tcKlnKxnY2t%2FdYKMsJ%2ByZZOku7TBzJ6prGWUpHqiusNmm6impGLAqbvPZquhqp%2BqtKl5waugnKNdlrulecw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./occitanie-109-millions-deuros-pour-laeronautique-et-le-spatial.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>109 millions d'euros pour l'aronautique et le spatial</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mary-jo-young-releases-songs-i-was-gonna-sing-on-idol.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Mary Jo Young Releases 'Songs I Was Gonna Sing on Idol'</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./joe-biden-immigration-private-prisons.html>Biden Use of Private Migrant Centers Grows Amid Border Surge</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-often-should-you-replace-your-shoes.html>How Often Should You Replace Your Shoes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1550102-james-bond-actors-order-how-played-iconic-spy.html>James Bond actors in order: how many played the iconic spy?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./0-28804-1898067-1938106-1938103-00-html.html>Jeff Han - TIME 100 Roundtables</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-cnsa-adopte-sa-convention-socle-avec-les-departements.html>La CNSA adopte sa convention socle avec les dpartements</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogZ.
