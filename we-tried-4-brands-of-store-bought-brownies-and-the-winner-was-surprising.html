Since we <a href=# id=20e2a823-031c-346d-a133-8dc1d4e51690>taste tested</a> everything from <a href=# id=f7dc80c9-a024-3850-a74a-9dc6e38de05d>packaged doughnuts</a> to <a href=# id=b77f3663-1057-3ede-a918-06b32e9a9f09>cookie dough</a> , I decided to taste test how some of the store-bought treats measure up to freshly baked brownies.</p><p>I enlisted my roommate to help me wade through this sugar rush and together we purchased and sampled four brands from a New York City grocery store.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>The brands we tried were:</p><ul class=list><li>Entenmann's — $2.49.</li><li>Fiber One —$4.49</li><li>Enjoy Life — $4.69</li><li>Little Debbie —$1.99</li></ul><p>Keep scrolling to see which brand we couldn't get enough of.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-8>We started with Entenmanns Little Bites brownies.</h3></p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-8cf3d8f4-7926-3046-a6c6-02206e5efba7 data-caption="brownies taste test"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/uE1ktktTURBXy9jZGZjZmZjMS1jYmI5LTRmMjQtODk3ZC01NzBhZGJhY2QxMjkucG5nkZUCzQMWzQJRwsM></span><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Full disclosure: I've always loved Entenmann's Little Bites. Growing up, I would pack these bite-sized brownies in my lunch bag as a mid-day treat. So going into this taste test, I knew I was going to be a little biased, but tried to keep an open mind.</p><p>Upon first bite, I was instantly taken back to my childhood as the rich chocolate flavor entered my mouth. But once I stepped back from my nostalgia, I could objectively see that the brownie had a somewhat stale taste and was not as soft as I remember. In my opinion, the Little Bites were a bit dry and not as smooth as my memory recalls.</p><p>Yet, something kept pulling me back — I'm even eating one as I write this at my desk at work. Despite being a bit dry for my taste, this was still a delicious and enjoyable snack. At $2.49 for 20, this is a solid treat.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-13>Next, we moved on to Enjoy Lifes chocolate fudge brownies — and almost had to stop the entire experiment.</h3></p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-32558a31-0a45-4759-b767-5d14ddf3f0b3 data-caption="brownie taste test"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/0PnktktTURBXy8yODAyYWRkYS1iNmRjLTRlYzMtODQyNS1jMzBmNWEzN2NmYjAucG5nkZUCzQMWzQJRwsM></span><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>My first red flag with Enjoy Life's double chocolate brownies was that they were sitting in a bizarre-looking tray. Also, they were strangely shaped — probably due to the fact that they are advertised as chocolate brownie "cookies."</p><p>Maybe this was also why the texture felt all wrong to me. These brownies were so dense that it felt like I was gnawing on hardened Play-Doh. The taste also seemed off in my opinion. On the box, it says the brownie cookies are made with "ancient grains," and boy do you taste it.</p><p>This was particularly frustrating considering that these brownies were the most expensive of the bunch, at $4.69.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-18>We then tasted the Fiber One brownies and were pleasantly surprised.</h3></p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-864f8804-0472-41c5-a16a-3998e7ab3db0 data-caption="Brownie taste test"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/32XktktTURBXy8zODZhZWNmMi1lNGIxLTRjYWEtYTRiMi1jYzQxZWFiNWEwOTAucG5nkZUCzQMWzQJRwsM></span><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>After coming down from the Enjoy Life incident, I was wary of trying another healthy option like Fiber One's brownie. Since the cute packaging was alluring, I was excited to taste the treat and put the grainy brownies behind me.</p><p>I was instantly surprised by how homemade this brownie tasted. It was soft and gooey, reminding me of a freshly baked brownie. The hardened frosting that was drizzled all over the baked treat added an exciting crunch, enhancing the texture even more.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-a10723e2-1eda-40aa-9e42-0b399b8af238 data-caption="Brownie taste test"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/DUOktktTURBXy9kMWIxM2Q2ZC04MjU4LTRiYTMtYjVlNy1jNTAzYWM0MTU1ZWEucG5nkZUCzQMWzQJRwsM></span><p>Despite the Fiber One brownie being a healthier option, it was surprisingly delicious and did not disappoint.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-aac72e26-f658-4c94-b1eb-a5d6e0d35dc6 data-caption="brownie taste test"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/JFPktktTURBXy9kYzg0MjAyOC1jOGM3LTQ3MDMtODg0Ni05MjAwZjA0NDhmNTUucG5nkZUCzQMWzQJRwsM></span><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-26>Lastly, we tried the Little Debbie Cosmic brownies.</h3></p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-53a9f66d-2d32-41bb-8070-2ed155c589a7 data-caption="brownies taste test"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/w8OktktTURBXy8xNDM2NTYzNy1kNDA1LTRkMjEtODMwNS1jNTFlNjMzMDUxNWYucG5nkZUCzQMWzQJRwsM></span><p>The Little Debbie Cosmic brownies come in individual baggies and are decorated with colorful "chocolate chip candy." The brownie looked appetizing with its shiny fudge layer and vibrant sprinkles.</p><p>The first bite was delicious. It had a smooth, chocolatey taste, but when I bit into one of the sprinkles everything changed. The hard crunch of the candy mixed with the smooth texture of the brownie was not good. Each bite into the sprinkles sent an explosion of sugar onto my taste buds, making for a way too sweet and intense flavor in my opinion.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>But my roommate offered a brilliant idea: Take the sprinkles off of the brownie and it might improve the overall taste. I gave it a shot, and it was much, much better. Although the brownie itself tasted a little bit artificial, it was the only brownie that had a deliciously creamy chocolate taste. Plus, at $1.99 for a box, who can resist?</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-5e742244-5fc2-45f1-afcf-95a2cca8a0b9 data-caption="Brownies taste test"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/lPiktktTURBXy80ZTM3ZmVlZi04NjAxLTQyNjgtOGM0MS0wNTE4NzBkMGE0MzcucG5nkZUCzQMWzQJRwsM></span><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-32>The verdict.</h3></p><p>The most important takeaway is that you don't need to turn on the oven to enjoy a tasty brownie. There are pre-packaged options in grocery stores that taste just as delicious, <strong>most notably the Fiber One brownie</strong> , which reigns supreme in this taste test.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkr6p7y6Kdnqukrrmme9aeZK2qmZqxboCMm6mappSoerCyjKyrqKqVYq%2Bwwcahq2aaoqTEr7XErGSappRiwamxjLCgp6aVp3q4rdJmqq6qoKe2tLXNoGZwqWeruHm0</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./15-clever-gravestones-by-people-whose-sense-of-humor-will-live-forever-445660.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>15Clever Gravestones byPeople Whose Sense ofHumor Will Live Forever</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./uba-launches-life-changing-promo-tagged-uba-bumper-account.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>UBA launches life changing promo tagged UBA Bumper Account</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./joe-biden-immigration-private-prisons.html>Biden Use of Private Migrant Centers Grows Amid Border Surge</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-often-should-you-replace-your-shoes.html>How Often Should You Replace Your Shoes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1550102-james-bond-actors-order-how-played-iconic-spy.html>James Bond actors in order: how many played the iconic spy?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./0-28804-1898067-1938106-1938103-00-html.html>Jeff Han - TIME 100 Roundtables</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-cnsa-adopte-sa-convention-socle-avec-les-departements.html>La CNSA adopte sa convention socle avec les dpartements</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogZ.
