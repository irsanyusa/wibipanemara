Despite the fact that the actress is&nbsp;perfect at&nbsp;portraying the roles of&nbsp;sophisticated aristocrats, <strong>she herself is&nbsp;from a&nbsp;simple <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a></strong>. Her mother was a&nbsp;secretary and her father was a&nbsp;medical worker.</li><li>The girl had been dreaming about the theater since childhood but her parents never shared those aspirations. In&nbsp;fact, her mother <a href=#>doubted</a> that a&nbsp;girl “with a&nbsp;face like that” could ever become an&nbsp;actress.</li></ul><p><h2>Smith in the early 1950s</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/359/455/fdacda5b95aedf15508bb69a8c.jpg><ul><li>But the girl was persistent. At&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;17, she <a href=#>started</a> to&nbsp;study acting and debuted on&nbsp;a&nbsp;big stage just one year later. Her first work was as&nbsp;the role of&nbsp;Viola in&nbsp;Shakespeare’s Twelfth Night.</li><li>It’s hard to&nbsp;believe it&nbsp;now, but Maggie <a href=#>started</a> her <a href=# title=career data-link=tag>career</a> as&nbsp;a&nbsp;comedic actress and toured with commercial productions for several years.<strong> She would sing, dance, and entertain the public.</strong> At&nbsp;22, she was already <a href=#>performing</a> in&nbsp;a&nbsp;Broadway show.</li></ul><p><h2>Maggie Smith in the musical, Oh!

The driver recognized me&nbsp;from Downton and asked me&nbsp;when the next season started. Before I&nbsp;could tell him, he&nbsp;said, ‘I always watch it&nbsp;when football isn’t on,’ and that sure put me&nbsp;in&nbsp;my&nbsp;place.”</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/658/a79/6f3ecc5fe9890041a8b6780a70.png><ul><li>For her contribution to&nbsp;the arts, the actress <a href=#>was appointed</a> a&nbsp;Commander of&nbsp;the Order of&nbsp;the British Empire, which is&nbsp;a&nbsp;female version of&nbsp;a&nbsp;knight. The collection of&nbsp;her achievements even includes <strong>prestigious scientific awards</strong>. 3&nbsp;famous British universities granted her the title of&nbsp;Doctor of&nbsp;Letters, though Smith doesn’t have any education apart from theater school.</li><li>Her personal life <a href=#>looked like</a> a&nbsp;plot of&nbsp;a&nbsp;melodrama. The woman got into a&nbsp;relationship with the playwright, <a href=#>Beverley Cross</a>. He&nbsp;was already married at&nbsp;that time so&nbsp;Smith decided not to&nbsp;wait for him to&nbsp;get a&nbsp;<a href=# title=divorce data-link=tag>divorce</a> and married actor <a href=#>Robert Stephens</a>. The <a href=# title=marriage data-link=tag>marriage</a> turned out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;unsuccessful since the up-and-coming Stephens drank a&nbsp;lot and his career <a href=#>went</a> downhill.</li></ul><p class=adme-img-description>Smith with her first husband and eldest son, Chris</p><ul><li>Maggie Smith gave birth to&nbsp;2&nbsp;sons in&nbsp;her marriage with Stephens and both of&nbsp;them followed in&nbsp;their parents’ footsteps. <a href=#>Chris Larkin</a> acted in&nbsp;several movies but never became famous, while the younger kid, <a href=#>Toby Stephens</a>, got famous after having played James Bond’s main rival in&nbsp;the movie, Die Another Day. His other famous role was the pirates’ captain in&nbsp;the <a href=#>Black Sails</a> TV&nbsp;series.</li></ul><p class=adme-img-description>Smith with her younger son, Toby</p><ul><li>Soon after her divorce, Smith got married, yet again, to&nbsp;her first love, Beverley Cross. They lived 22&nbsp;years together until the moment that he&nbsp;<a href=#>died</a> from an&nbsp;illness. The actress had a&nbsp;hard time overcoming the death of&nbsp;her beloved. In&nbsp;one of&nbsp;her interviews, she <a href=#>said</a>, “Everybody says it&nbsp;gets better, but&nbsp;I don’t think it&nbsp;does. It&nbsp;gets different.”</li><li>Cross has always been Smith’s biggest fan and supported her when <strong>she was diagnosed with Graves’ disease at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;54</strong>. This <a href=#>thyroid disease</a>, which is&nbsp;accompanied by&nbsp;weakness and a&nbsp;frightening enlargement of&nbsp;the eyes, could’ve put an&nbsp;end to&nbsp;Smith’s career. But she <a href=#>underwent</a> radiation therapy and ophthalmic surgery to&nbsp;treat the illness.</li></ul><p class=adme-img-description>Smith with her second husband, Beverley Cross</p><ul><li>Maggie Smith quickly achieved success in&nbsp;the theater and was considered a&nbsp;favorite of&nbsp;many directors, but ordinary viewers only learned about her after seeing her in&nbsp;Harry Potter, when the actress was almost 70&nbsp;years old. She herself <a href=#>jokes</a> that “she had not existed” before&nbsp;it.</li><li>Out of&nbsp;all of&nbsp;the movies, she <a href=#>likes</a> the first part of&nbsp;the franchise where she changed from a&nbsp;cat. It&nbsp;seems that Smith has a&nbsp;special relationship with animals. She even <a href=#>took part</a> in&nbsp;a&nbsp;fundraising campaign for stray cats in&nbsp;the&nbsp;UK where celebrities created artwork that was then sold at&nbsp;an&nbsp;auction and donated to&nbsp;fund cats’ protection.</li><li>At&nbsp;the same time, <strong>Smith calls her work in&nbsp;Harry Potter unsatisfactory,</strong> because in&nbsp;these movies, she wasn’t <a href=#>feeling</a> “real acting” as&nbsp;she did in&nbsp;other films.</li></ul><p><h2>Smith's role in Harry Potter alongside her character from Divine Secrets of the Ya‑Ya Sisterhood</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6cb/2cf/894ba751818e15714ea4b7587d.jpg><ul><li>While shooting Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, <strong>Smith was battling <a href=# title="breast cancer" data-link=tag>breast cancer</a></strong>. She was feeling even <a href=#>worse</a> from her medicine and was exhausted so&nbsp;she withdrew herself. After having finally overcome the disease, Smith <a href=#>said</a>, “The last couple of&nbsp;years have been a&nbsp;write-off, though I’m beginning to&nbsp;feel like a&nbsp;person now. My&nbsp;energy is&nbsp;coming back. S***&nbsp;happens. I&nbsp;ought to&nbsp;pull myself together a&nbsp;bit.”</li><li>Smith has always been critical toward her talent and never misses a&nbsp;chance to&nbsp;joke about herself. She once <a href=#>said</a> about one of&nbsp;her awards that the judges simply hadn’t decided on&nbsp;who else to&nbsp;give it&nbsp;to. Another one of&nbsp;her awards was met with the following ironic <a href=#>comment</a>: “I&nbsp;just feel ever so&nbsp;humble. It&nbsp;does seem awfully unfair and&nbsp;I can’t help feeling it’s because I&nbsp;am so&nbsp;old.”</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a58/fe4/2fe0fd5364bfb24666dbcc5df8.jpg><ul readability=10.823529411765><li readability=7.633423180593><p>Because of&nbsp;the disease, Maggie had to&nbsp;leave her beloved theater career for 12&nbsp;years.
