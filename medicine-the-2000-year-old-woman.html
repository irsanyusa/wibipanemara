Last week they released the results of their autopsy: Lady Li died of an apparent heart attack. Although there was nothing unusual about the cause of her death, the post-mortem examination at Hunan Medical College was somewhat out of the ordinary; Lady Li, whose body was unearthed from a tomb outside the central Chinese city of Changsha, died at the age of 50 some 2,100 years ago.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Modern medical techniques have been used many times to examine the remains of long-buried people. Studies of mummies have revealed that many ancient Egyptians had dental problems, arthritis, pneumonia and plague. Egypt’s legendary Merneptah, the Pharaoh of the Hebrew Exodus, suffered from arteriosclerosis. But Lady Li’s body is unquestionably the best preserved ever to be subjected to a full-fledged autopsy.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Lady Li’s tomb was uncovered by Chinese archaeologists, who determined by the pottery, clothing and other artifacts found inside that it had been built during the early Western Han Dynasty, which ruled China from 206 B.C. to A.D. 24. The tomb was immediately recognized as a major historical and artistic find. But it was not until archaeologists began to exhume the body of Lady Li, whose husband was the Marquis of Tai, that they realized that they had made a significant scientific discovery as well.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Lady Li’s silk-wrapped body had been placed inside an airtight coffin that was the innermost of six boxes packed in five tons of charcoal, completely surrounded by a layer of white clay and, finally, buried under more than 60 ft. of earth. Furthermore, inside the inner coffin scientists found a reddish, mildly acid fluid containing mercurial compounds that preserved body moisture and helped retard decomposition.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Perfect Preservation. As a result of the conscientious efforts of the Han Dynasty embalmers, Lady Li’s body was in a remarkable state of preservation. Doctors who examined it discovered that the flesh was not dried like that of a mummy, but still moist. They also found the hair well anchored in the scalp and the joints still flexible. Although Lady Li’s brain had collapsed into a shapeless mass, her other internal organs were in excellent condition.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Specialists called in from Peking, Shanghai and Canton discovered from chemical analysis of Lady Li’s hair and tissues from her stomach, liver, muscles and bone that she had type A blood. Gynecological examination revealed that she had borne children.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">X-ray examination showed that she had broken her right forearm; the discovery of spots in her left lung confirmed that she had had tuberculosis; and an examination of her gall bladder disclosed several gallstones. Her digestive tract showed that she had eaten melon shortly before her death; 138 melon seeds were found, all undigested.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It took further study—and a little deductive reasoning—to determine why Lady Li died. The autopsy revealed that one of her coronary arteries was almost completely occluded by atherosclerosis.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">This alone, the doctors felt, was enough to kill Lady Li and, they speculate, her death was probably sudden. If she had been ill for a long time before her death, doctors reasoned, she probably would have developed bedsores. The postmortem examination showed none.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmaaqpOdtrexjm9vbWlnaX1wucSdoJyhnpp6tbTEZmlpaGBixqat0WampZxdrLyurc1o</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./pollution-de-lair-utiles-la-sensibilisation-les-micro-capteurs-ne-peuvent-se-substituer-aux-mesures.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>utiles la sensibilisation, les micro-capteurs ne peuvent se substituer aux mesures rglementaire</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./le-ministere-de-linterieur-ouvre-un-espace-dedie-aux-zsp.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Le ministre de l'Intrieur ouvre un espace ddi aux ZSP</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./joe-biden-immigration-private-prisons.html>Biden Use of Private Migrant Centers Grows Amid Border Surge</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-often-should-you-replace-your-shoes.html>How Often Should You Replace Your Shoes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1550102-james-bond-actors-order-how-played-iconic-spy.html>James Bond actors in order: how many played the iconic spy?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./0-28804-1898067-1938106-1938103-00-html.html>Jeff Han - TIME 100 Roundtables</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-cnsa-adopte-sa-convention-socle-avec-les-departements.html>La CNSA adopte sa convention socle avec les dpartements</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogZ.
