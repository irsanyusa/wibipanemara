Heated blankets are great because they can warm up one’s body more quickly than your standard blanket as they often are powered by electricity. Some heated blankets can even be taken outside and are made to withstand some water contact.</p><p>I’ve compiled a list of the best heated blankets to keep you warm this winter and beyond, taking into consideration the insights from fire safety experts Daniel Majano, Program Manager of the <a rel=nofollow href=#>Electrical Safety Foundation</a>, and Brad Maggard, Fire Marshal of <a rel=nofollow href=#>Ashland Fire Fighters Local 706</a>.</p><h2 id=our-top-picks-for-the-best-heated-blankets>Our top picks for the best heated blankets</h2><h3>Best heated blanket for extra warmth: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Rovify Electric Heated Blanket</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best heated blanket for extra warmth</span></p><p><h3 class=title>2X Warmth Heated Blanket w/Lager Dense Area, Ultra Soft Safe Electric Blanket Throw w/Flannel Sherpa, 4 Levels Instant Heating Blanket 4H Auto-Off, Washable Blanket UL Certified</h3></p><p>The Rovify Electric Heated Blanket may be just what you’re looking for if you seek extra warmth.

We also conducted online research to discover the best heated blankets by reviewing both the product information and customer reviews of heated blankets from a variety of brands and <a rel=alternate href=#>places to buy bedding</a>.</p><h2 id=how-to-choose-the-best-heated-blankets>How to choose the best heated blankets</h2><h3>Size and dimensions</h3><p>When determining the size of the heated blanket you plan on purchasing, think about where you’ll be putting it. The great thing about heated blankets is many are available in a variety of sizes including throw, twin, full, queen, and king. If you plan on wearing it or using it as a shawl as you watch TV, I recommend a throw-size blanket with dimensions around 50 x 60 inches or so. However, if you plan on using your new heated blanket when napping or lounging in bed, opt for a blanket with a size that matches that of your bed. For example, if you have a <a rel=alternate href=#>king size mattress</a>, order a king-size heated blanket.</p><h3>Material</h3><p>Material is important when it comes to your heated blanket because you want to ensure comfort. Sherpa, polyester, fleece, and flannel are some of the most common materials for the best heated blankets. If you prefer a fluffy feel, opt for a heated blanket made from Sherpa like the Rovify Electric Heated Blanket. If you plan on taking your blanket outside or are someone prone to spills, blankets like the Cozee Portable Battery Powered Heated Blanket are made with water-resistant materials.</p><h3>Heat settings</h3><p>The number of heat settings for the best heated blankets varies. They typically range between three and 20. Some heated blankets like the <a rel=nofollow href=#>Berkshire Corduroy Stripe Electric Heated Blanket</a> have two controllers which can be beneficial if people with different temperature preferences want to share a blanket.</p><h3>Safety features</h3><p>Being mindful when it comes to a heated blanket’s safety features, as safety is key when making any purchase, but especially those involving heat and electricity. “You’ll want to make sure they [heated blankets] are UL-listed,” says Maggard. “This means that a banket has been listed by Underwriters Laboratories which means that they’ve certified it to be a safe product to use.” He adds, “I would stick with name brand blankets as they are generally safer than something you might buy online that you’ve never heard of before.” An ETL (Electrical Testing Laboratories) certification is another one to keep an eye out for when shopping.</p><h2 id=what-is-the-difference-between-an-electric-blanket-and-a-heated-blanket>What is the difference between an electric blanket and a heated blanket?</h2><p>According to Majano, “heated blankets are not always electric, as they may be heated by another source. However, electric blankets are heated blankets.”</p><h2 id=when-is-the-best-time-to-buy-a-heated-blanket>When is the best time to buy a heated blanket?</h2><p>Although there is no definitive answer as to when is the best time to buy a heating blanket, many purchase them when the weather becomes cooler.</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>Is it safe to sleep with a heated blanket?</h3><p>Although we wouldn’t recommend sleeping with a heated blanket, it can be safe to sleep with a heated blanket “as long as they are used according to manufacturer’s instructions,” says Maggard. “Don’t lay on top of them as they are supposed to be on top of you, and don’t compress them.” Make sure any pillows or other items aren’t resting on top of them.</p><p>As far as using a heated blanket with a memory foam <a rel=alternate href=#>mattress topper</a>, luxury mattress retailer Saatva says there are <a rel=nofollow href=#>mixed opinions</a> but not from a safety perspective. The concern is that heat from the blanket will soften the foam, making it less supportive to sleep on.</p><h3>Can you use a heated blanket while pregnant?</h3><p>Allison K. Rodgers, M.D, gynecologist and director of education at <a rel=nofollow href=#>Fertility Centers of Illinois</a> explains that pregnant individuals should avoid using heated blankets. “Increased core temperature during pregnancy can be dangerous for the fetus. When you or I are hot, we sweat, flush, and can remove clothing. However, a fetus inside our body can’t do that, and its temperature and heartbeat can rise to a dangerous level.”</p><h3>How do you care for a heated blanket?</h3><p>You can care for a heated blanket by keeping it clean. Although not all heated blankets permit washing, some do. If that is the case, wash them according to the manufacturer’s directions.</p><h3>Can you wash a heated blanket?</h3><p>In general, washing a heated blanket is not recommended. “We recommend not washing electric blankets as water and electricity do not mix,” explains Majano. “If the blanket comes with a removable cover that does not contain electrical components, then you could wash [the removable cover].” However, there can be some exceptions to this if stated in the manufacturer’s instructions. If the heated blanket you purchase can be washed, make sure to thoroughly read through the user guide and safety manual to ensure that you properly remove any parts that need to be removed before doing so to clean it without causing any harm to the blanket (or yourself).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme8Geqq1lmJqutbHDZpmlmZ6gsrW%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./discover-your-romantic-spirit-in-scotlands-beautiful-outdoors.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Discover your romantic spirit in Scotland's beautiful outdoors</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./angelina-jordan-performs-at-the-2022-fifa-football-awards.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Angelina Jordan Performs at the 2022 FIFA Football Awards</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./joe-biden-immigration-private-prisons.html>Biden Use of Private Migrant Centers Grows Amid Border Surge</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-often-should-you-replace-your-shoes.html>How Often Should You Replace Your Shoes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1550102-james-bond-actors-order-how-played-iconic-spy.html>James Bond actors in order: how many played the iconic spy?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./0-28804-1898067-1938106-1938103-00-html.html>Jeff Han - TIME 100 Roundtables</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-cnsa-adopte-sa-convention-socle-avec-les-departements.html>La CNSA adopte sa convention socle avec les dpartements</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogZ.
