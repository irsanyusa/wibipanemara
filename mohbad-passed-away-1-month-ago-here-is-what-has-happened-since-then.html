He soon became a fast-rising star under the Marlian Music record label, headed by popular singer, <strong>Naira Marley</strong>, until he left the label in 2022, becoming independent.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Mohbad became a force to be reckoned with musically and was an easily relatable celebrity with music for the streets that Nigerians vibed with.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-6>What happened to Mohbad?</h3></p><p>According to the police, the singer was administered injections by a <a href=# id=01703933-dd09-4db0-b425-3eab45d859e1 data-link-role-code=open_new_tab>quack nurse</a> named <strong>Feyisayo Ogedengbe</strong>. Said injections, consisting of tetanus toxoid, paracetamol, and an antibiotic known as Cetrazone triggered an immediate reaction, including vomiting, goosebumps and convulsions, after which he passed.</p><p>He was then rushed to Perez Medcare Hospital for medical attention, but was pronounced dead on arrival. According to a statement by the medical facility, <a href=# id=229f0036-a8f8-4aff-85e9-99dd23faf972 data-link-role-code=open_new_tab>he did not die in their hospital</a>, and all efforts at resuscitation failed.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-10>The burial</h3></p><p>Mohbad was buried the very next day in the Ikorodu area of Lagos State by his family. The early burial confused the singer's fans and Nigerians at large, given that he was not a Muslim.</p><p>However, <a href=# id=e1a3b783-6597-4bee-8640-ccdf6c854fe0 data-link-role-code=open_new_tab>Mohbad's father</a>, <strong>Joseph Aloba</strong>, spoke up, stressing that he was quickly buried because he was young. He also noted that the land on which he was buried was the only property that he knew his son owned.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-14>Call for investigations and an autopsy</h3></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Shortly after his passing, Nigerians began to clamour for an investigation into his death, considering its sudden nature. According to people around Mohbad, he had performed at a concert two days before his passing and there was nothing wrong with him. This then raised the question in everyone's mind "What happened to Mohbad?"</p><p>A social media campaign by Nigerians began demanding that an autopsy be conducted on Mohbad to determine the cause of his death. Petitions were written to the Governor of Lagos, <strong>Babajide Sanwo-Olu</strong>, and <a href=# id=ce18b0de-2ff3-46c8-89b1-6defd2a2a4f4 data-link-role-code=open_new_tab>to the state's head coroner</a> as well.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-19>Naira Marley and Sam Larry</h3></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Between 2020 and 2022, Mohbad was signed to Naira Marley's record label under which he released some of <a href=# id=51a5dc02-fa03-4428-bee0-82c2b7b1a952 data-link-role-code=open_new_tab>his biggest hit songs</a>.</p><p>Before his death, he was involved in a legal battle with the record label to recover some of his royalties. Following his passing, videos surfaced online of assault and harassment he suffered at the hands of music promoter Sam Larry and the record label. The most damning video was one made by Mohbad himself crying that Naira Marley be held responsible if anything happened to him.</p><p>The reemergence of the videos on social media after his death enraged Nigerians to call for Marley and Larry's <a href=# id=d20fc670-f882-4ec6-a3ff-760a9d084114 data-link-role-code=open_new_tab>immediate arrest</a>. But at the time, both parties were out of the country and <a href=# id=a73f70ad-cbac-4ff0-8296-5a07965b48e0 data-link-role-code=open_new_tab>claimed innocence</a> because neither of them were in Nigeria when the singer passed away.</p><p>Upon invitation by the police, both suspects <a href=# id=d431c207-9026-4005-8997-1974bbecd1cc data-link-role-code=open_new_tab>returned to Nigeria</a> to assist with the ongoing investigations.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-8ad19c58-ce73-42bc-9085-de93dc0df457 data-caption="Evidence links Naira Marley, Sam Larry with cyberbullying, assault of Mohabd - Police.
