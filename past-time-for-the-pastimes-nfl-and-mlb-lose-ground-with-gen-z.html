Social media has also elevated the profiles of those athletes, who are spending most of the game on the field of play and -- unlike football or baseball stars -- aren’t partially concealed by helmets or time in the dugout.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Coming into the 2018 season, the NFL has seen its TV ratings fall by about 17 percent since the 2015 season, according to Nielsen average TV viewership figures. Younger fans prioritizing other leagues could exacerbate the decline.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">A 2017 Magna Global <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>study</a> conducted for SportsBusiness Journal underscored the advantage the NBA and MLS have with younger fans, citing Nielsen statistics. The median age of MLS and NBA viewers in 2016 was 40 and 42, respectively, compared with a median age of 50 for the NFL viewer and 57 for MLB.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">The study also found that the median age of MLB and NFL viewers both went up by four years compared to 2006, versus 1- and 2-year increases for the median MLS and NBA viewers.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">And then there’s the other elephant in the room regarding the league’s long-term viability: Emerging science on the effects of repeated concussions is already draining the NFL’s potential talent pool, with more parents refusing to let their children play the game.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">“There certainly is a correlation between playing it and wanting to watch it or follow it at the college or pro level,” Billing said. “So they need to work toward doing everything they can to make parents feel comfortable letting their kids play organized football.”</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">That, coupled with the turn away from network TV viewing, suggests the NFL should be taking a harder look at its future.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">“The NFL has been so dominant for so long” that the league doesn’t see the latest dip as anything more “than a bump in the road, but they need to change their model,” Durbin said. “If you stay on an irrelevant model for too long, you become irrelevant.”</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Gen Z adults were only 6 points less likely to rate the NFL as their favorite sports league, keeping the league’s perch as the most popular sport among that group -- at least for now. The same can’t be said for baseball: At 15 percent, the youngest adults were a full 10 points less likely to say they favor MLB than adults as a whole, within the margin of error compared to the 12 percent of Gen Zers who said they preferred MLS.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZK6zwMico56rX6WutMCMraCmnV2bvLN506GcZqiRqMGqucSsZKeenGKur7CMpqObZZykwKZ5xqumrqaUYsSqwMdmnp6mXa8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./rugby-vs-american-football-differences.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Rugby vs. American football: what are the differences?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./lassemblee-adopte-definitivement-la-loi-sur-la-protection-de-lenfant.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>L'Assemble adopte dfinitivement la loi sur la protection de l'enfant</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./joe-biden-immigration-private-prisons.html>Biden Use of Private Migrant Centers Grows Amid Border Surge</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-often-should-you-replace-your-shoes.html>How Often Should You Replace Your Shoes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1550102-james-bond-actors-order-how-played-iconic-spy.html>James Bond actors in order: how many played the iconic spy?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./0-28804-1898067-1938106-1938103-00-html.html>Jeff Han - TIME 100 Roundtables</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-cnsa-adopte-sa-convention-socle-avec-les-departements.html>La CNSA adopte sa convention socle avec les dpartements</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogZ.
