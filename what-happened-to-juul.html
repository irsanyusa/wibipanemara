I finished writing my book, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Big Vape: The Incendiary Rise of Juul</a>, in January 2021, at a time when the future of both mega-popular vaping brand <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Juul Labs</a> and the entire U.S. e-cigarette industry were in flux. Each time news broke after the draft was done, I wished I could go back and update it—but of course that wasn’t possible.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I got some closure when my book was adapted into a Netflix docuseries, Big Vape: The Rise and Fall of Juul, which premiered Oct. 11. The series’ producers worked on it long after my book came out, allowing them to weave in big developments that hadn’t happened when I finished writing—but even still, the story of Juul and vaping is ongoing, and no one knows how it will end.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Here’s what has changed since Big Vape was published, and what I view as the biggest question marks about the vaping industry.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Regulators banned Juul…then </strong>back-tracked</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has long played catch up when it comes to regulating the vaping industry. Brands including Juul were already widely available nationwide when, in 2016, the agency <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">finalized a process for assessing their health effects</a>. That meant e-cigarette companies already in business had to retroactively prepare paperwork to prove that their products were beneficial for public health; if they couldn’t convince the FDA, regulators could order them to stop selling their vapes in the U.S.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">When I finished writing Big Vape, Juul had submitted its application but the FDA hadn’t reached a verdict yet. Then, in a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">dramatic decision in June 2022</a>, the FDA said Juul had not provided adequate toxicology data for its products and ordered them off the market.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Then, following an appeal from Juul, the FDA began a <a href=#>secondary review of its data</a>, which is still in progress. Meanwhile, Juul devices remain on the market. It's already been more than a year since that all happened, and the FDA has given little public indication about what it will ultimately decide.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Juul has also submitted an application for a new product: a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bluetooth-enabled “next-generation” device</a> that’s meant to lock out underage users and reject counterfeit pods, but it’s anyone’s guess whether the FDA will authorize it.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Tobacco giant Altria broke up with Juul</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">At the end of 2018, the tobacco giant Altria (which owns the company that makes Marlboro cigarettes) <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">paid almost $13 billion for 35% of Juul</a>. But as scrutiny on Juul grew and the FDA cracked down on its marketing and sales practices, Altria valued its investment lower and lower—down to just $250 million by the end of 2022. In March 2023, Altria announced it would <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">exchange its minority ownership stake for the right to license</a> some of Juul’s intellectual property, a signal that Juul’s business had suffered enough that the Big Tobacco company wanted to move on. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Altria also purchased NJOY</a>, a different e-cigarette maker.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">That’s only one element of Juul’s financial struggles. Juul has been sued by everyone from school districts to state attorneys general for its role in the teen vaping epidemic, and over the past couple years, it has <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">agreed to pay nearly $3 billion in legal settlements</a>. Juul’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">revenue is also significantly down</a> from its peak, and the company has been through <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">multiple rounds of layoffs</a>.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Teens have largely moved on from Juul</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Juul became notorious for being the e-cigarette teens used in school bathrooms and on Snapchat. But these days, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">federal data suggest underage users have mostly moved on</a> to single-use vaporizers that—unlike Juul, which is now only available in tobacco and menthol varieties—come in tons of flavors. Among the roughly 10% of U.S. teens who regularly vape, more than half now use disposable e-cigarettes, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">according to the FDA</a>. My anecdotal research backs this up. When I’m walking around my neighborhood in Brooklyn, I see tons of teenagers with vapes made by brands like Elf Bar and Air Bar, and hardly any hitting Juuls.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">For the record, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">most disposable vapes are not supposed to be sold to anyone</a>, underage or not, because they haven’t gotten authorization from the FDA. But it’s proven so difficult for the agency to keep up with regulating a large and ever-changing market that many continue to be widely available.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>There is (still) a lot of debate about the risks and benefits of vaping</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">This was true when I began covering vaping in 2018 and it’s still the case now. Some <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">researchers believe vaping can help adults stop smoking cigarettes</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">transition to a less-dangerous form of nicotine</a>. Meanwhile, other studies find that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">vaping is not an effective way to stop smoking</a> and may come with significant health risks of its own, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">including increased chances of developing lung and heart diseases</a>. The big caveat to the whole debate is that e-cigarettes only became widely used and studied within the past couple decades, which is not all that long in the world of health research. More health risks—or benefits—could come to light as vapers are studied for years to come.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">One thing, however, remains clear: the safest choice is not to use any tobacco product at all.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZva2JngHeEjrCfmqxdna6xvMSnnJ1lpKR6q8HUpWY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jamie-foxx-ed-sheeran-before-he-was-famous-graham-norton-show-1202477734.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jamie Foxx Let Ed Sheeran Crash on His Couch Before the Brit Made it Big (Watch)</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./1242672-ota-postal-code-full-list-by-area-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Ota postal code full list by area</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./joe-biden-immigration-private-prisons.html>Biden Use of Private Migrant Centers Grows Amid Border Surge</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-often-should-you-replace-your-shoes.html>How Often Should You Replace Your Shoes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1550102-james-bond-actors-order-how-played-iconic-spy.html>James Bond actors in order: how many played the iconic spy?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./0-28804-1898067-1938106-1938103-00-html.html>Jeff Han - TIME 100 Roundtables</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-cnsa-adopte-sa-convention-socle-avec-les-departements.html>La CNSA adopte sa convention socle avec les dpartements</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogZ.
