Much has changed over the intervening decade—perhaps most significantly that Xi will be expected to shake hands with a suspected war criminal upon arrival, following the International Criminal Court’s issuance of an <a href=#>arrest warrant for Vladimir Putin</a> on Friday.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The charges, which Putin rejects and relate to the alleged forced deportation of Ukrainian children, were announced just hours before the Russian president visited Mariupol—his first trip to occupied Ukraine since the start of the war. Putin may well still have dust from the beleaguered city on his boots when he welcomes Xi, with the two leaders expected to sign “important documents” that will “deepen relations” and solidify economic cooperation, according to Kremlin officials.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Still, the overwhelming impression has been that Xi is heading to Russia with the aim of negotiating a settlement to the Ukraine conflict—a presumption bolstered by China’s remarkable brokering earlier this month of <a href=#>restored ties between Iran and Saudi Arabia</a>, as well as by reports that Xi will also hold a <a href=# rel=noopener>virtual meeting</a> later this week with Ukrainian President <a href=#>Volodymyr Zelensky</a>, their first direct conversation since Russia invaded more than a year ago.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“My upcoming visit to Russia will be a journey of friendship, cooperation and peace,” Xi wrote in an <a href=# rel=noopener>article</a> for the Kremlin-run <i>Russian Gazette</i> newspaper published Monday. Putin, meanwhile, wrote his own <a href=# rel=noopener>commentary</a> in the Chinese Communist Party mouthpiece the <i>People’s Daily</i> on Sunday that welcomed his “good old friend” Xi to make a “meaningful contribution to the settlement of the crisis.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">However, the likelihood that Xi can somehow persuade both Russia and Ukraine to agree to a truce <a href=#>remains remote</a>. “A ceasefire in the current situation is very difficult—both sides think they can win, they cannot give up,” says Prof. Wang Yiwei, director of the Institute of International Affairs at Renmin University in Beijing. “I don’t expect anything helpful to come out of this visit,” says Sean King, senior vice president of political risk firm Park Strategies.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In fact, it doesn’t look like Ukraine is Xi’s primary focus anyway. Of the more than 1,800 words Xi wrote in the <i>Russian Gazette</i>, “Ukraine” featured just three times in two adjacent paragraphs. He devotes much more space to eulogizing bilateral relations and that bilateral trade soared to $190 billion last year (while glossing over the fact that this was largely as a consequence of evading Western sanctions).</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Xi’s focus, says Wang, will be to “manage spillover effects including the food crisis, humanitarian crisis, energy [supply disruptions] and global supply chain connectivity”—matters directly relevant to China’s interests, in other words.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Moreover, Xi will be less inclined to alienate Putin given Russian support is increasingly important geostrategically. Last week’s signing of an enhanced AUKUS security pact between the U.S., U.K., and Australia, which allows the latter to acquire and operate <a href=#>nuclear-powered submarines</a>, has put Xi on the defensive in his own backyard. “AUKUS forces China and Russia to cooperate in a more strategic way,” says Wang.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Alexander Korolev, an expert in China-Russia relations at the University of New South Wales, says that Xi wants to consolidate his alignment with Putin because Russia is China’s only strategic partner that is a great power. “China will need Russia for its impending conflict with the U.S.,” he says. “Xi Jinping cares about China’s interests and problems in the Asia Pacific. He doesn’t care about Ukraine or the war there.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“It just goes to show that autocrats stick together,” says King.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">For Xi, there is also a clear propaganda element. His <i>Russia Gazette</i> article talks up his “new type of international relations and a community with a shared future for mankind”—<a href=# rel=noopener>his pitch</a> to replace existing U.S.-dominated global governance mechanisms with new “multipolar” relations.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As such, the Moscow trip is another opportunity to paint himself as a neutral party and the U.S. in particular as stoking the conflict. “To run the world’s affairs well,” writes Xi, “one must first and foremost run its own affairs well.” To hammer that point home, China also released on Monday its annual “<a href=# rel=noopener>State of Democracy in the United States</a>“ assessment—which, while breathtakingly hypocritical, does point out some undeniable flaws in American governance.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">With the entire world—especially developing nations of the Global South—hostage to the inflation and instability wrought by the conflict, Xi will take every chance to paint the U.S. as an aggressor at least as guilty as Putin. And Western cynicism regarding any proposed Chinese attempts to negotiate peace is portrayed as self-serving. “The U.S. saw the Ukraine crisis as a lucrative opportunity,” says the report on the U.S. “Instead of taking any measures conducive to ending hostilities, the U.S. kept fueling the flames and made a huge fortune from the war business including the arms industry and the energy sector.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Meanwhile, China’s proposals of compromise and dialogue—nebulous as they undoubtedly are—stand in stark contrast to American bickering about the type and quantity of deadly weaponry to dispatch to the frontline. “Increasingly, Western rhetoric about the Ukraine conflict is seen as shrill, increasingly prone to conspiracy theories and misinformation, and warmongering in itself,” writes Chris Devonshire-Ellis, chairman of business consultancy Dezan Shira & Associates, in a <a href=# rel=noopener>briefing note</a>. “The non-Western world increasingly sees this as a desire to continue the conflict—instigated by the West.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Xi’s visit is a clear example of “balance of power politics 101,” says Korolev. “There is a growing understanding in Beijing that China and the United States are on a collision course. That is not going to change.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvamZpgXKCjrGgZqKZo72qusZmp66smaN6s8HSrKCaZaaewKrAjK6iq5mZo7Jw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./7-old-african-hairstyles-that-are-coming-back-in-vogue.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>7 old African hairstyles that are coming back in vogue</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mike-wazowski-meme.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>This Monsters Inc Faceswap Meme Will Make You Nostalgic</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./joe-biden-immigration-private-prisons.html>Biden Use of Private Migrant Centers Grows Amid Border Surge</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-often-should-you-replace-your-shoes.html>How Often Should You Replace Your Shoes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1550102-james-bond-actors-order-how-played-iconic-spy.html>James Bond actors in order: how many played the iconic spy?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./0-28804-1898067-1938106-1938103-00-html.html>Jeff Han - TIME 100 Roundtables</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-cnsa-adopte-sa-convention-socle-avec-les-departements.html>La CNSA adopte sa convention socle avec les dpartements</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogZ.
