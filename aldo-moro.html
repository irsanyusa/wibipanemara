His promising career was brought to a sudden and tragic end when he was kidnapped and subsequently killed by the Red Brigades in 1978.</p><p>Moro received his education in Apulia before attending the University of Bari, where he graduated with a law degree in 1939. He embarked on an academic career, teaching philosophy of law and criminal law at the University of Bari in the early 1940s.</p><p>During his academic years, Moro became involved with the Italian Catholic Federation of University Students and established a significant connection with Giovanni Battista Montini, who later became Pope <a href=#>Paul VI</a>.</p><p>With the fall of fascist rule in Italy, Moro entered the political arena, meeting key figures such as Alcide De Gasperi and helping to draft the Code of Camaldoli, an economic guideline for the Christian Democrats. In 1943, he co-founded the magazine La Rassegna and in 1945, married Eleonora Chiavarelli, with whom he had four children.</p><p>After World War II, Moro was elected to the Constituent Assembly, contributing to the drafting of the Italian Constitution. His political career continued with his appointment as Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs under the De Gasperi government. He went on to hold several ministerial roles, including Italian Minister of Justice and Minister of Public Education.</p><p>In 1959, Moro ascended to the position of secretary for the Christian Democrats and assumed the office of Prime Minister for the first time in 1963, heralding the formation of the first center-left government, termed the Centro-sinistra organico ("organic center-left").</p><p>Moro's leadership was characterized by significant social reforms, such as housing legislation, establishing university student grants, and broadening of social security and health insurance coverage. The Vajont Dam disaster struck during his term, and Moro took decisive action against those deemed responsible.</p><p>In foreign policy, Moro adopted a pro-Arab stance and successfully negotiated the Moro pact with Palestinian entities. His involvement in the Osimo Treaty, which settled the dispute over Trieste between Italy and Yugoslavia, stirred controversy and opposition, with some even seeking Moro's prosecution.</p><p>The 1970s marked a period where Moro's vision for the Historic Compromise aimed at integrating the Italian Communist Party into a wider democratic arena. This policy placed him at odds with both the US and the USSR amidst Cold War tensions.</p><p>On March 16, 1978, Moro's life took a grim turn when he was abducted by the left-wing militant group, the Red Brigades. The nation was dragged into an extensive but fruitless effort to rescue him. After 55 days of captivity, he was murdered by his kidnappers.</p><p class=info><b>Born:</b> <a href=#>September 23</a>, <a href=#>1916</a><br><b>Birthplace:</b> Maglie, Apulia, Italy</p><p class=info><b>Generation:</b> <a href=#><b>Greatest Generation</b></a><br><b>Chinese Zodiac:</b> <a href=#>Dragon</a><br><b>Star Sign:</b> <a href=#>Libra</a></p><p class="info no-margin-bottom"><b>Died:</b> <a href=#>May 9</a>, <a href=#>1978</a> (aged 61)<br><b>Cause of Death:</b> <a href=#>Assassination</a></p><span class=list-clearfix></span><h2>Historical Events</h2><ul class=event-list><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1963-12-04</a> Aldo Moro forms Italian government (1963-1968)</li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1978-03-16</a> Red Brigade kidnaps former premier Aldo Moro in Italy, 5 killed</li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1978-05-09</a> Corpse of kidnapped Italian ex-premier Aldo Moro found</li></ul><h2>References</h2><br><a href=# class=section__link><h2>Famous Italians</h2></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sLrToaCsnJGue6S7zGinnqegobJwrcudpmaln6e8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./best-dinnerware-sets.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Best Dinnerware Sets That Combine Quality and Style</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./williams-uchemba-quits-public-gym-to-focus-on-heaven-here-is-why-video.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Williams Uchemba quits public gym to focus on heaven; here is why (VIDEO)</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./joe-biden-immigration-private-prisons.html>Biden Use of Private Migrant Centers Grows Amid Border Surge</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-often-should-you-replace-your-shoes.html>How Often Should You Replace Your Shoes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1550102-james-bond-actors-order-how-played-iconic-spy.html>James Bond actors in order: how many played the iconic spy?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./0-28804-1898067-1938106-1938103-00-html.html>Jeff Han - TIME 100 Roundtables</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-cnsa-adopte-sa-convention-socle-avec-les-departements.html>La CNSA adopte sa convention socle avec les dpartements</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogZ.
