It is fronted by a digital rendition of the Roman goddess Venus as depicted in Sandro Botticelli’s 15th century renaissance masterpiece <a href=# rel=noopener><i>Birth of Venus</i></a>, wearing a mini-skirt, holding a smart-phone, and eating pizza.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The digital rendition of Venus also comes with an <i>Emily in Paris</i>-style <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram account</a> with 34,000 followers and counting. The page features photos of Venus posing in front of various Italian landmarks, such as the Colosseum and Pantheon.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">A campaign ad—which aims to boost international tourism in Italy—features idyllic stock footage that isn’t even in Italy. One scene shows people drinking Slovenian wine on a patio in the village of Gorjansko, in neighboring Slovenia’s Komen municipality.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The campaign makes its international debut at the Arabian Travel Market (ATM) tourism show in Dubai from May 1 to 4. Here’s everything to know about the campaign.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>How are Italians reacting</b></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The campaign has been ridiculed by Italians on social media who say it cements tired stereotypes of the country. Art historian Tomaso Montanari called it “grotesque” and said it was an “obscene” waste of money, while the culture ministry’s undersecretary Vittorio Sgarbi told <i>La Repubblica</i>, “I don’t want to contradict my colleagues too much. But ‘Open to Wonder?’ What is that? What language is that?”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Art historian Livia Garomersini was also quoted in a statement reported by <a href=# rel=noopener>ArtNet,</a> saying, “where is the art, where is the promotion in this hackneyed jumble of clichés?” She said the campaign “trivializes our heritage in the most vulgar way.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Uffizi Gallery in Florence, which houses Botticelli’s <i>Birth of Venus </i>painting, has not commented on the campaign. But Florence’s mayor Dario Nardella said that this is emblematic of a wider cultural problem. “We’re fighting against commercial exploitation that ridicules our artistic jewels, like the aprons showing the statue of David’s private parts or grotesque reproductions of works of art in stupid poses,” he said.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>What has Italy’s tourism ministry said about the reaction?</b></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Tourism minister Santanchè has said that the project sells “our nation in an unseen way that has never been done before.” She also told a local radio station that she had seen and enjoyed the memes that the campaign is generating online.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I consciously chose Botticelli’s Venus, an icon known throughout the world and a symbol of our Italian spirit,” she said.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Santanchè also speculated about why people have criticized the use of pizza in the computer generated images. “I don’t understand the criticism, pizza is famous all over the world, it is part of the Mediterranean diet and of our cuisine, which is appreciated, imitated, and copied all over the world,” she said. “Perhaps it is criticized by the slightly snobby and radical chic people who eat caviar and salmon.”</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>Why tourism in Italy can be controversial</b></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The campaign has brought to light the sometimes complicated and fraught issue of tourism, with many citing the reality that Italian tourist spots like Venice are often overcrowded and subject to misuse.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In June, two American tourists caused <a href=# rel=noopener>$25,000 worth of damage</a> to the Spanish Steps in Rome by throwing scooters down them. Other incidents recorded in 2022—of which there are many—saw an American smash two sculptures in the Vatican Museum when he was told he would not see the pope.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">To combat overcrowding, Venice has announced a <a href=# rel=noopener>booking system</a> for visitors (which charges for entry) that took effect in January. Meanwhile, in influencer hotspot Portofino, tourists can be charged for hovering in beauty spots for too long while taking photos.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">All of this has left many to wonder what good a digital Venus and her Instagram can do for the nation.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvamdqfnl%2FjqKrmqSpYrCwutOrpq%2Bdoqi2oriMraauqpmoum6tw2atnqalqHw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./use-food-improve-skin-2.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>5 Ways to Improve Your Skin Through Food</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./want-to-keep-your-teens-or-employees-from-texting-behind-the-wheel.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Want to Keep Your Teens (or Employees) from Texting Behind the Wheel?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./joe-biden-immigration-private-prisons.html>Biden Use of Private Migrant Centers Grows Amid Border Surge</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-often-should-you-replace-your-shoes.html>How Often Should You Replace Your Shoes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1550102-james-bond-actors-order-how-played-iconic-spy.html>James Bond actors in order: how many played the iconic spy?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./0-28804-1898067-1938106-1938103-00-html.html>Jeff Han - TIME 100 Roundtables</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-cnsa-adopte-sa-convention-socle-avec-les-departements.html>La CNSA adopte sa convention socle avec les dpartements</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogZ.
