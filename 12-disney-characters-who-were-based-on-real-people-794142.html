Many of&nbsp;their characters have become our favorites, and some of&nbsp;them are really close to&nbsp;our hearts. However, what you probably don’t know is&nbsp;that many of&nbsp;them were based on&nbsp;real people and in&nbsp;some cases, celebrities.</p><p><strong>Bright Side </strong>would like to&nbsp;show you a&nbsp;selection of&nbsp;iconic Disney characters that were based on&nbsp;real people, and compare them to&nbsp;the those who served as&nbsp;inspiration for bringing them to&nbsp;life.</p><p><h2>1. The 4&nbsp;vultures&nbsp;— The Beatles</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/160/1a6/baec8850628f8ecb67b3d7e218.jpg><p>While producing the animated version of&nbsp;the novel <a href=#>The Jungle Book</a>, <a href=#>Disney</a> and the filmmakers in&nbsp;charge of&nbsp;the adaptation, <a href=#>conceived</a> a&nbsp;rather ingenious cameo of&nbsp;<a href=#>The Beatles</a>. It&nbsp;was 1967 and they were already one of&nbsp;the most popular bands of&nbsp;the time.</p><p><a href=#>John Lennon</a>, <a href=#>Paul McCartney</a>, <a href=#>George Harrison</a>, and <a href=#>Ringo Starr</a> would provide the voices behind the 4&nbsp;vultures. The animals would also have crazy hairstyles and sing the song That’s What Friends Are For. However, although the band inspired the birds, this was not enough reason to&nbsp;go&nbsp;ahead with the plan.</p><p>It’s been said that Lennon preferred to&nbsp;not appear in&nbsp;the <a href=# title=film data-link=tag>film</a>. He&nbsp;explained to&nbsp;the band’s manager, <a href=#>Brian Epstein</a>, that he&nbsp;should tell Disney that it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;better idea to&nbsp;hire <a href=#>Elvis Presley</a>. Due to&nbsp;his decline, the film only shows the vultures speaking in&nbsp;an&nbsp;accent similar to&nbsp;that of&nbsp;people living in&nbsp;Liverpool, with the voices of&nbsp;<a href=#>J.&nbsp;Pat O’Malley</a>, <a href=#>Digby Wolfe</a>, <a href=#>Lord Tim Hudson</a>, and <a href=#>Chad Stuart</a>.</p><p><h2>2. Maleficent&nbsp;— Eleanor Audley</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/688/6fd/f477915857b73be54b317d5300.jpg><p><a href=#>Eleanor Audley</a> not only gave a&nbsp;voice to&nbsp;<a href=#>Maleficent</a> in&nbsp;<a href=#>Sleeping Beauty</a>, but Disney filmmakers also <a href=#>asked</a> her to&nbsp;perform and film the scenes that would help the animators produce the fictional character. This means that the actress’ features and gestures inspired the movements and face of&nbsp;Maleficent.<br>Additionally, Eleanor also served as&nbsp;<a href=#>inspiration</a> for creating the animated character, <a href=#>Lady Tremaine</a>, <a href=#>Cinderella</a>’s legendary and evil stepmother.</p><p><h2>3. Jessica Rabbit&nbsp;— Rita Hayworth</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f25/f3b/95de985274943d7bd4875795df.jpg><p>The bombshell of&nbsp;<a href=#>Who Framed Roger Rabbit?</a> became an&nbsp;icon due to&nbsp;her portrayal in&nbsp;the film and her stunning figure. But her appearance wasn’t just a&nbsp;matter of&nbsp;luck: <a href=#>Jessica Rabbit</a> was <a href=#>based</a> on&nbsp;the beautiful actress <a href=#>Rita Hayworth</a>.</p><p>At&nbsp;the beginning of&nbsp;the character <a href=# title=design data-link=tag>design</a>, the writer <a href=#>Gary K. Wolf</a> based her on&nbsp;the dancer of&nbsp;the animated short film <a href=#>Red Hot Riding Hood</a>, created by&nbsp;<a href=#>Tex Avery</a>. However, during the production of&nbsp;the movie, Jessica Rabbit’s image shifted. This shift was inspired by&nbsp;several actresses, but mostly by&nbsp;Rita. <a href=#>Richard Williams</a>, the director of&nbsp;animation for the film, said he&nbsp;tried to&nbsp;make the character look similar to&nbsp;Hayworth, but with <a href=#>Veronica Lake</a>’s hair.</p><p><h2>4. The Mad Hatter&nbsp;— Ed&nbsp;Wynn</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/281/827/3fe4965fa0905ffa942d21ed73.jpg><p><a href=#>The Mad Hatter</a> is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;Alice’s most distinctive and unique characters in&nbsp;<a href=#>Alice in&nbsp;Wonderland</a>. In&nbsp;the film, the Hatter was <a href=#>inspired</a> by&nbsp;the gestures, appearance, and personality of&nbsp;the actor <a href=#>Ed&nbsp;Wynn</a>. He&nbsp;was also the voice behind the character, so&nbsp;it’s fair to&nbsp;say that he&nbsp;served as&nbsp;a&nbsp;perfect model for the animators to&nbsp;use to&nbsp;design the Hatter.</p><p><h2>5. Edna Moda&nbsp;— Linda Hunt</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/766/868/2d5b605a49ad5597f9e93625bc.jpg><p><h2>6. Scat Cat&nbsp;— Louis Armstrong</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a51/c44/5c27535e4689f335fe2a83eb68.jpg><p>Scat Cat from <a href=#>The Aristocats</a> was a&nbsp;role originally <a href=#>written</a> for <a href=#>Louis Armstrong</a>, the distinguished jazz singer and trumpeter. The idea was that he&nbsp;would give voice to&nbsp;the popular cat, which was originally going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;named Satchmo the Cat.</p><p>Unfortunately, because of&nbsp;unexpected health problems, Armstrong couldn’t be&nbsp;part of&nbsp;the project. This forced the filmmakers to&nbsp;replace him with the musician <a href=#>Scatman Crothers</a>. For this reason, they renamed the character Scat Cat, and wrote a&nbsp;new song for him that Crothers performed.</p><p><h2>7. Dr. Facilier&nbsp;— Michael Jackson</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8df/851/b37faa52db9f798c1c2091d453.jpg><p>Dr. Facilier, the villain in&nbsp;the movie <a href=#>The Princess and the Frog</a>, was <a href=#>based</a> on&nbsp;<a href=#>Michael Jackson</a>. The strong resemblance between the 2&nbsp;is not only evident in&nbsp;his slim figure and choice of&nbsp;clothes, but also in&nbsp;the choreography Dr. Facilier’s character performs throughout the film. The mannerisms and postures are the same as&nbsp;those the “King of&nbsp;Pop” used to&nbsp;display.</p><p><h2>8. Ariel&nbsp;— Alyssa Milano</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/954/6ea/cfd45552808af6b531132772a3.jpg><p>When the creative brains of&nbsp;Disney began to&nbsp;design the character of&nbsp;Ariel for <a href=#>The Little Mermaid</a>, they wanted to&nbsp;portray the image of&nbsp;a&nbsp;beautiful, sweet, and contemporary young woman, so&nbsp;they used <a href=#>Alyssa Milano</a> for inspiration.</p><p><br>During an&nbsp;interview, the actress <a href=#>revealed</a> that she wasn’t aware of&nbsp;this, at&nbsp;least not when the character was being produced. Later&nbsp;on, however, she was invited to&nbsp;present a&nbsp;documentary where the producers showed how the movie was made. It&nbsp;was then that she discovered that Ariel was based on&nbsp;her. The creators of&nbsp;the tape had used pictures of&nbsp;her during her teens to&nbsp;recreate the unforgettable mermaid.</p><p><h2>9. Ursula&nbsp;— Divine</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ddb/cb7/71db295ca5bb60b8f577c03a2b.jpg><p>Harris Glenn Milstead, also known as&nbsp;<a href=#>Divine</a>, was a&nbsp;distinguished American actor and drag queen who served as&nbsp;<a href=#>inspiration</a> for creating the evil Ursula from <a href=#>The Little Mermaid</a>. His shows and presentations were critical for shaping the features, stunning style, and personality of&nbsp;the villain.</p><p><h2>10. Alice&nbsp;— Kathryn Beaumont</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/540/153/e684cc5fb8b6a160c69216e195.jpg><p>The leading character in&nbsp;<a href=#>Alice in&nbsp;Wonderland </a>was based on&nbsp;the actress <a href=#>Kathryn Beaumont</a>. She also provided the voice for Alice. The company’s animators used the girl as&nbsp;a&nbsp;model to&nbsp;bring Alice to&nbsp;life. She was only 10-years-old at&nbsp;the time. Countless <a href=#>photographs</a> depict the Kathryn’s work, and there’s even a&nbsp;<a href=#>video</a> where she’s seen acting and voicing the role of&nbsp;Alice.</p><p><h2>11. Cruella de&nbsp;Vil&nbsp;— Tallulah Bankhead</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c73/91d/96910f5db59820a4f18bc5beeb.jpg><p><h2>12. Snow White&nbsp;— Marge Champion</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/38f/10c/c2799d597289cd82c63888bcbf.jpg><p><a href=#>Marge Champion</a> was one of&nbsp;the most emblematic dancers of&nbsp;the twentieth century. When she was only&nbsp;14, the young artist <a href=#>auditioned</a> for the role of&nbsp;<a href=#>Snow White</a>. Her job was to&nbsp;recreate the character’s scenes in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;the animators. In&nbsp;doing&nbsp;so, however, she was asked to&nbsp;keep the elegance and delicate movements of&nbsp;her dancing experience that also characterized the princess.</p><p>One of&nbsp;the reasons why Marge got the role was because of&nbsp;her father. She had an&nbsp;exceptional talent for dancing and acting, but was also raised and behaved like royalty. <a href=#>Ernest Belcher</a>, Marge’s dad, taught her to&nbsp;bow and regularly behave very delicately. Her upbringing allowed her to&nbsp;get the role because her gestures and postures were similar to&nbsp;those the producers wanted for Snow White.</p><p>Which character on&nbsp;the list surprised you the most?
