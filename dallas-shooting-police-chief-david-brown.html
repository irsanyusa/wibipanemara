Brown has seen loss from several perspectives: He lost his former partner in the line of duty, his brother due to crime and his son after he killed a police officer.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As Dallas reels from shootings that left five officers dead and seven others wounded, Brown has been thrust into the national spotlight.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Here’s what you need to know.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>He lost his former partner in a fatal shooting</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In 1988, Brown was called to the scene of an officer-involved shooting only to learn that his former police academy classmate and partner had been <a href=# rel=noopener>ambushed and shot in the head</a>. Walter L. Williams, a father of three, died in the hospital hours later.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“When things like that happen and you’re really close, you don’t believe it for the longest time,” he <a href=# rel=noopener>told the Dallas Morning News</a> when he was sworn in as chief in 2010. “I really relate to all of those in-the-line-of-duty deaths [on a] much more personal level … you lose a partner, you just never get over it.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>His brother was killed by drug dealers</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In 1991, his younger brother Kelvin was killed in the Phoenix area by drug dealers. Brown doesn’t speak much about the event, but he <a href=# rel=noopener>told the Morning News</a> that it deepened his understanding of his job.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I can’t deny that’s a part of who I am,” he told the newspaper. “The families of victims, I know what they go through. My family had to go through that. But does it make me police in a different manner or lead in a different manner? I’m not sure.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>His son killed a police officer and a bystander</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In 2010, the same year Brown was sworn in as chief, his son began acting erratically at an apartment complex in the Dallas suburb of Lancaster, then <a href=# rel=noopener>shot and killed a stranger and a police officer </a>before being killed by police himself.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Brown later took off his badge to meet with the family of the victims.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“David was very humble. You know, he never made any excuses for his son. David’s a strong, Christian man, and so he relies on his faith to get through each day, and that was demonstrated during the whole incident that happened in Lancaster,” former Lancaster Police Chief Keith Humphrey told TIME.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Humphrey, who is now chief of police in Norman, Okla., said he has known Brown in a professional capacity for almost a decade. He helped facilitate the meetings between Brown and the victims’ families but did not stay.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“What I do remember hearing David say as I’m walking out of the room, exiting the room, that he said, first of all, ‘I’m very sorry, and that is not the way I raised my son.’ I don’t know what else happened inside those meetings, they were very private. But I think that helped all three families start healing,” Humphrey said.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>He’s intensely private</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Brown is known for not having many personal friends and disliking <a href=# rel=noopener>sitting down with the media</a>. He <a href=# rel=noopener>runs his own Twitter account</a> in part to control his public messages.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Anna Hill, president of the Dolphins Heights Neighborhood Association in Dallas, said she has known Brown for a long time, but she still mostly talks to him for professional reasons, but that he’s always responsive.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“He takes his job seriously. He takes community seriously,” she told TIME. “If we have a problem in our neighborhood and we contact him, he answers.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Humphrey described Brown as “introverted,” but a dynamic leader.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“It’s not about David, it’s about others,” Humphrey said. “David is an amazing leader. What you see is what you get on TV. He’s not putting on an act, and he’s definitely not performing for the media. David cares. He’s hurting.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZta2ltg3qEjp2YpaSRqHq0tM6oq6Kml2K9sLjInJxmm5iesqd5w5qtopxdl7%2Bww81o</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./49877-ethnic-minority-britons-at-the-2024-general-election.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ethnic minority Britons at the 2024 general election</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./20-ordinary-girls-proved-you-dont-need-to-be-an-artist-to-do-cool-makeup-796076.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>20+ Ordinary Girls Proved You Dont Need to Be an Artist to Do Cool Makeup</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./joe-biden-immigration-private-prisons.html>Biden Use of Private Migrant Centers Grows Amid Border Surge</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-often-should-you-replace-your-shoes.html>How Often Should You Replace Your Shoes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1550102-james-bond-actors-order-how-played-iconic-spy.html>James Bond actors in order: how many played the iconic spy?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./0-28804-1898067-1938106-1938103-00-html.html>Jeff Han - TIME 100 Roundtables</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-cnsa-adopte-sa-convention-socle-avec-les-departements.html>La CNSA adopte sa convention socle avec les dpartements</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogZ.
