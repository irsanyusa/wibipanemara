The First Lady emeritus, who had arrived to rehearse only that morning, read her score (solo passages underlined in black ink, lines with orchestral accompaniment in red) with a mellow distinctness, never missed a cue. The audience called her back for five rousing curtain calls. Said Conductor Serge Koussevitzky ecstatically: “Now the First Lady of the world is not only a grandmother to her own grandchildren, but, through her participation in Peter and the Wolf, a grandmother to the children of the world.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Her own first and only great-grandchild was already taking his appointed place in the family circle.

Jimmy suggested that old Legionnaire Truman might like to come out for the American Legion Convention in Los Angeles this October. “I hope to see the President in California before the election,” said Candidate Roosevelt, “and I know the President wants to attend.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">All in Good Time</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Conferred on General Mark Clarlc, Chief of Army Field Forces, by Brazil’s President Eurico Gaspar Dutra: the honorary rank of general in the Brazilian army.

Then the happy couple flew to Manhattan. Flynn bade a fond farewell to Patrice and shoved off to make a movie in Paris, where his prospective leading lady will be his next-to-latest fiancee, Rumanian Princess Irene Ghica.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmaaqpOdtrexjm9tam1jZoRwvMSop6WdXaWysLzLnmSarZdif3J5kHJsaWc%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./princess-nokia-thinks-ariana-grandes-new-song-7-rings-sounds-really-familiar-and.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Princess Nokia thinks Ariana Grande's new song '7 Rings' sounds 'really familiar' and implied the si</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mrs-doubtfire-review-musical-broadway-1235126621.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Mrs. Doubtfire Review: An Unmemorable Broadway Musical Banks on Familiar Material</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./joe-biden-immigration-private-prisons.html>Biden Use of Private Migrant Centers Grows Amid Border Surge</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-often-should-you-replace-your-shoes.html>How Often Should You Replace Your Shoes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1550102-james-bond-actors-order-how-played-iconic-spy.html>James Bond actors in order: how many played the iconic spy?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./0-28804-1898067-1938106-1938103-00-html.html>Jeff Han - TIME 100 Roundtables</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-cnsa-adopte-sa-convention-socle-avec-les-departements.html>La CNSA adopte sa convention socle avec les dpartements</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogZ.
