But how about the other way around, when the movie actually includes scenes that are not found in&nbsp;the book? This makes for a&nbsp;better movie, for sure. And here are some movies that used the book as&nbsp;a&nbsp;reference, but with their own twist.</p><p>These movies made&nbsp;us at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> want to&nbsp;check out the books and compare the movies ourselves&nbsp;— we&nbsp;hope they make you curious too!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/13a/6d2/6d5a4a51d4866d9015dbf7ae08.jpg><p>Melissa Moseley / New Line Cinema / Collection Christophel / East News<span>, </span>Melissa Moseley / New Line Cinema / Collection Christophel / East News</p><p><i>The Notebook</i>, a&nbsp;well-known movie that left&nbsp;us all in&nbsp;tears with its ending, is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the movies that are better than the book. Its most loved scene, the one in&nbsp;which they both discover that their love never perished, is&nbsp;different in&nbsp;the book.</p><p>Abby Olaleye <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>explains</a>: “The famous scene where it&nbsp;is&nbsp;raining, and Allie goes ‘Why didn’t you write? It&nbsp;wasn’t over for&nbsp;me,’ with a&nbsp;reply from Noah saying, ‘I&nbsp;wrote you every day for a&nbsp;year.’ Then he&nbsp;kisses her. It&nbsp;doesn’t exactly happen that way. It&nbsp;was disappointing for me&nbsp;because, during the ‘365&nbsp;letters’ scene in&nbsp;the book, I&nbsp;wanted a&nbsp;kiss to&nbsp;happen, but&nbsp;I knew it&nbsp;wasn’t going to&nbsp;because it&nbsp;was too mundane. ”</p><p>One emblematic scene in&nbsp;the movie that is&nbsp;not found in&nbsp;the book is&nbsp;the iconic ending. The movie takes a&nbsp;more tragic approach, with both characters passing away in&nbsp;each other’s arms, however, the ending of&nbsp;the book is&nbsp;romantic. This is&nbsp;definitely a&nbsp;change worth taking note&nbsp;of.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/768/f04/782b835c4e9d66b913f1626df9.jpg><p>Strong Heart Demme Production / Collection Christophel / East News</p><p><i>Silence of&nbsp;the Lambs</i> is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;those iconic movies people are re-watching to&nbsp;this day. Despite the book being widely regarded as&nbsp;good, the film still made its way into the list of&nbsp;movies that are better than the book to&nbsp;some extent. Not when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;particular scenes, though, but to&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>character </a>of&nbsp;Hannibal Lecter. It’s one thing to&nbsp;read the book and imagine the characters, but it’s way different actually seeing them on-screen. Anthony Hopkins and the crew did an&nbsp;amazing job at&nbsp;bringing Hannibal to&nbsp;life and giving him a&nbsp;story.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5d2/3a0/04fd705c02bd7d77572922c187.jpg><p>Image supplied by Capital Pictures / EAST NEWS</p><p>The 1975 movie adaptation of&nbsp;Peter Benchley’s novel, <i>Jaws</i>, also qualifies for the list of&nbsp;movies that are better than the book. In&nbsp;some books, the plot tends to&nbsp;stretch out over a&nbsp;long time, which can be&nbsp;boring, unlike in&nbsp;a&nbsp;movie which&nbsp;— due to&nbsp;time management, has to&nbsp;incorporate everything that is&nbsp;important and eye-catching so&nbsp;as&nbsp;not to&nbsp;bore the audience.</p><p>In&nbsp;this case, the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>plot </a>between the chief’s wife and a&nbsp;marine biologist tends to&nbsp;be&nbsp;too long and pointless for the general action. In&nbsp;the movie, though, it&nbsp;seems this is&nbsp;not the case, which definitely made the adaptation a&nbsp;lot more interesting and exciting.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/638/b8c/561884590480d161d64a6e5398.jpg><p>As&nbsp;with every Disney movie, the changes were quite drastic. The original<i> Beauty and the Beast</i> was published by&nbsp;the French <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>author</a> Jeanne Marie Leprince de&nbsp;Beaumont in&nbsp;1756. From here, a&nbsp;plethora of&nbsp;movies and plays emerged, however, the one we&nbsp;all know and love is&nbsp;Disney’s animated adaptation from 1991. Given that it’s an&nbsp;animated film meant for kids, a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;the characters we&nbsp;see on&nbsp;screen are not in&nbsp;the original book.</p><p>As&nbsp;a&nbsp;matter of&nbsp;fact, the only common character is&nbsp;Belle’s father. Even Gaston was created specifically for the movie, along with Le&nbsp;Fou, Cogsworth, Lumière, Mrs. Potts, and Chip. These added characters definitely earned the 1991 movie adaptation a&nbsp;place on&nbsp;the list of&nbsp;<strong>movies that are better than the book</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1cc/a54/4947215852900829afffeb4bab.jpg><p>Paramount Pictures / Collection Christophel / East News</p><p>Similarly to&nbsp;Hannibal, the protagonist in&nbsp;<i>Forrest Gump</i> was brought to&nbsp;life in&nbsp;a&nbsp;more interesting way in&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>movie</a>, rather than the book. In&nbsp;the book, Forrest has a&nbsp;very childlike personality, however, at&nbsp;times he&nbsp;can be&nbsp;quite violent. He&nbsp;even curses&nbsp;— something which definitely did not make the cut in&nbsp;the movie adaptation.</p><p>Speaking of&nbsp;the adaptation, <i>Forrest Gump</i> the movie took a&nbsp;similar approach, but in&nbsp;the end, portrayed Forrest in&nbsp;a&nbsp;way that made him more loved: a&nbsp;childlike personality, a&nbsp;soft way of&nbsp;speaking, and a&nbsp;certain innocence. Thanks to&nbsp;his genuine self, he&nbsp;made the movie better than the book.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ba0/4ba/9068e058b3aec137d85d2d72f8.jpg><p>Paramount / Courtesy Everett Collection / Everett Collection / East News</p><p>You might not be&nbsp;aware, but the iconic movie <i>Mean Girls</i> was actually inspired by&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>book </a>written in&nbsp;2002. <i>Queen Bees and Wannabes</i> was written by&nbsp;Rosalind Wiseman and read by&nbsp;Tina Fey a&nbsp;few years later. She got the idea for a&nbsp;movie and, with help from other writers, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wrote </a>the script for what we&nbsp;have come to&nbsp;know as&nbsp;<i>Mean Girls</i>. Of&nbsp;course, that was not the only contribution Tina Fey had to&nbsp;its production, she also played Ms. Norbury, the math teacher.</p><p>The movie is&nbsp;undeniably a&nbsp;staple with a&nbsp;twist, different from its original inspiration. Due to&nbsp;its originality and place in&nbsp;everyone’s hearts, it&nbsp;definitely deserves a&nbsp;place on&nbsp;the list of&nbsp;movies that are better than books.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b2b/607/c6172b51a89a2eb685d3f6d318.jpg><p>Fox 2000 Pictures / Regency Enterprises / Linson Films / Collection Christophel / East News</p><p>As&nbsp;mentioned previously, it’s a&nbsp;common thing for books to&nbsp;contain way more information than their subsequent movies. That’s not the case for the emblematic <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>movie adaptation</a> of&nbsp;<i>Fight Club</i>. Thanks to&nbsp;the amazing cast and scriptwriters, the movie quickly got ahead of&nbsp;the book. The details the movie brings, the drama, and the plot all contribute to&nbsp;the movie being better than the book. Moreover, Brad Pitt as&nbsp;the protagonist definitely made the movie that much better.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7f6/03b/50d1505faebf1c4468b2fe16d4.jpg><p>With a&nbsp;cast consisting of&nbsp;legends like James Caan, Al&nbsp;Pacino, and Marlon Brando, it’s no&nbsp;wonder the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>movie </a><i>The Godfather</i> did much better than the book it&nbsp;was originally inspired&nbsp;by. The book, written by&nbsp;Mario Puzo, is, to&nbsp;this day, his best-selling book. And the movie, directed by&nbsp;Francis Ford Coppola, took the already-amazing characters portrayed in&nbsp;the book and gave them life with astounding performances. With a&nbsp;cast like that and a&nbsp;professional director, the movie was definitely better than the book.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e7c/021/11e3325ad5bfba76aadc440d22.jpg><p>Image supplied by Capital Pictures / EAST NEWS</p><p>The ingenious movie we&nbsp;all know was actually adapted from a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>novel </a>written by&nbsp;Michael Crichton. <i>Jurassic Park,</i> the movie, made some changes to&nbsp;its characters&nbsp;— the novel has way too many&nbsp;— as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;the ending, which puts the movie on&nbsp;the list of&nbsp;movies that are better than the book.</p><p>In&nbsp;the novel, the crew manages to&nbsp;escape the ferocious dinosaurs and attempts to&nbsp;eradicate them and destroy the island, however, in&nbsp;the movie, this does not happen. Perhaps this is&nbsp;what made people enjoy the movie more, giving them hope that they might see the dinosaurs again, which did happen in&nbsp;the movies that followed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d46/9c8/839adb5a6caf5c1b6dc85251df.jpg><p>East News<span>, </span>East News</p><p>Sometimes, characters that are not the focus of&nbsp;a&nbsp;novel turn out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;quite important in&nbsp;the movies. This is&nbsp;what happened with the <i>Lord of&nbsp;the Rings</i> <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>movie</a>, making it&nbsp;one of&nbsp;those<strong> </strong>movies that are better than the book.</p><p>Having one character that was overlooked in&nbsp;the original book be&nbsp;involved in&nbsp;the plot can be&nbsp;a&nbsp;drastic change, but one that, for this particular movie, satisfied fans. The character, Arwen, got more screen time and substantial action in&nbsp;the movie, which, among other changes in&nbsp;production, made the adaptation that much more enjoyable.</p><p>Have you read any of&nbsp;the books or&nbsp;seen the movies?
