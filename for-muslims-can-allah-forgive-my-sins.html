Allah said, “O son of Adam, were your sins to reach the clouds of the sky and then you asked forgiveness from me, I would forgive you.”</p><p>You are not perfect, no one is. Even the prophets were fallible. Every person will commit sins; minor or major. This is why Allah mentions many times in the Qur’an that He is Al-Ghaffar (The Repeatedly Forgiving) and Ar-Rahim (The Exceedingly Merciful). All you need to do is ask, and He will forgive you.</p><p>The Prophet (SAW) reported that Satan said to Allah: “I shall continue to lead Your servants astray as long as their spirits are in their bodies.” And Allah replied: “I shall continue to pardon them as long as they ask for My forgiveness.”</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Allah said: “those who avoid great sins and Al-Fawahish (illegal sexual intercourse, etc.) except the small faults, verily your Lord is of vast forgiveness.” (53:32). Major sins include shirk (joining anything in worship with Him), murder, illegal sexual intercourse, consuming orphans’ wealth, consuming riba (usury), practicing magic, not carrying out major acts of worship (for no good reason), severing ties of kinship, disrespecting parents, drinking alcohol, gambling, and theft.</p><p>However, the Prophet (SAW) said: “no sin remains minor when accompanied by persistence, and no sin remains major when accompanied by the seeking of forgiveness.” Allah also says,“and those who, after they have committed Fahishah or wronged themselves with evil, remember Allah and ask forgiveness for their sins; - and none can forgive sins but Allah- And do not persist in what (wrong) they have done, while they know. For such, the reward is Forgiveness from their Lord, and Gardens with rivers flowing underneath (Paradise), wherein they shall abide forever. How excellent is this reward for the doers (who do righteous deeds according to Allah’s Orders)” (Qur’an 3:135-136).</p><p>When you commit a sin, you are doing wrong against your own self, as Allah says, “And whoever earns sin, he earns it only against himself. And Allah is Ever All-Knowing, All-Wise" (Qur’an 4:111). You cannot hurt Allah by your sin, like the famous statement Nigerian parents use after you do something wrong or foolish- “you think you are doing me? You are doing yourself!”</p><p>Since Allah has promised to forgive if you ask, and that He forgives all sins, it can be quite easy to get carried away and get up to all kinds of wrongdoing. But remember, “Allah accepts only the repentance of those who do evil in ignorance and foolishness and repent soon afterwards; it is they whom Allah will forgive and Allah is Ever All-Knower, All-Wise. And of no effect is the repentance of those who continue to do evil deeds until death faces one of them and he says: ‘Now I repent;’ nor of those who die while they are disbelievers. For them, We have prepared a painful torment" (Qur’an 4:17-18). As no one knows when death will visit him/her, it is best for to err on the side of caution.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>There are certain sins that you might commit often, no matter how much you try to stay away from them. Even after seeking forgiveness, you might find yourself going back to them. Then you might find yourself drowning in guilt, believing that you are beyond redemption. In fact, because of this, you might stop praying and other compulsory acts, even though that is another sin, as you believe you are condemned. Such thoughts are nothing but whispers of Satan. “Allah will not stop forgiving you unless you stop seeking forgiveness” - Prophet Muhammad (SAW).</p><p>Seeking forgiveness comes with multiple rewards. The Prophet (SAW), “no one forgives except that Allah increases his honour.” He also said, “if anyone continually asks pardon, Allah will appoint for him a way out of every distress & a relief from every anxiety, & will provide for him from where he did not reckon.”</p><p>Prophet Nuh (AS) said to his people when sent to warn them, “I said (to them): ‘ask forgiveness from your Lord; Verily, He is Oft-Forgiving; He will send rain to you in abundance, and give you increase in wealth and children, and bestow on you gardens and bestow on you rivers." (Qur’an 71:10-12)</p><p>It is a sign of faith for you to hope that Allah will forgive your sins. “And never give up hope of Allah’s Mercy. Certainly, no one despairs of Allah’s Mercy except the people who disbelieve." (Qur’an 12:87)</p><p>If you wish to be forgiven, you must also be forgiving to those who wrong you. “No mercy will be shown to those who show no mercy, and no forgiveness will be given to those who cannot forgive others,” according to Prophet Muhammad (SAW)</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>It is not as challenging to seek forgiveness when you do wrong, as it is to forgive someone who has wronged you. Evil can be avenged, but those who forgive instead will be rewarded. “Let them pardon and forgive. Do you not love that Allah should forgive you? And Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.” 1(Qur’an 24:22)</p><p>Allah descends every night to the lowest heaven when one-third of the night remains and says He will forgive whoever seeks His forgiveness. That is a golden opportunity which exists every day, all you need to do is take it.</p><p>The Prophet (SAW) said, “Allah, the Exalted, will continue to stretch out His Hand in the night so that the sinners of the day may repent, and continue to stretch His Hand in the daytime so that the sinners of the night may repent, until the sun rises from the west (start of day of judgement)”. He also said, “by Allah, I seek Allah’s forgiveness and repent to Him more than 70 times a day.”</p><p>Seeking forgiveness is as easy as saying ‘Astagfirullah’, which means ‘I seek the forgiveness of Allah.’ Once you commit a sin, regret it and want to be forgiven, you can say it, as many times as you can. There are many other prayers to seek forgiveness.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>The best way is by saying, “O Allah, You are my Lord, none has the right to be worshipped except You, You created me and I am Your servant and I abide by Your covenant and promise as best I can, I take refuge in You from the evil of which I have committed. I acknowledge Your favour upon me and I acknowledge my sin, so forgive me, for verily none can forgive sin except You.”</p><p>The Prophet (SAW) said of this prayer, “whoever says this during the day, believing in it with certainty, then dies on that day before evening comes, will be one of the people of Paradise, and whoever says it at night, believing in it with certainty, then dies on that night before morning comes, will be one of the people of Paradise.”</p><p>He also said, “whoever says ‘Subhanallahi wa bihamdihi, subhanallahil azeem’ which means ‘all glory is to Allah and all Praise to Him, Glorified is Allah, the Great’ hundred times a day will be forgiven all his sins, even if they were as much as the foam of the sea. This prayer is light on the tongue, heavy on the scale, and beloved to the Most Gracious.”</p><p>Part of the characteristics of Al-Muttaqun (the pious) who Allah promised Paradise is that they say, “Our Lord! We have indeed believed, so forgive us our sins and save us from the punishment of the Fire. And those who pray and beg Allah’s Pardon in the last hours of the night.” Qur’an 3:16-17</p><p>A person can seek forgiveness for himself and others. The Prophet (SAW) said, “a man’s rank in Paradise will be elevated, so He will ask, “How did I achieve this?” It will be said to him, “as a result of your child seeking forgiveness for you.”</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>“The angels glorify the praises of their Lord, and ask for forgiveness for those on the earth, verily, Allah is the Oft-Forgiving, the Most Merciful.” (Qur’an 42:5.) It is therefore good to ask for forgiveness constantly for one’s self and others.</p><p>Allah says, “Verily, I am indeed forgiving to him who repents, believes (in My Oneness, and associates none in worship with Me) and does righteous good deeds, and then remains constant in doing them (till his death).” Qur’an 20:82</p><p>Our Lord! Forgive me and my parents, and (all) the believers on the Day when the reckoning will be established.</p><p>This article was written by Muhammad-Salisu Safiyyah, a 5th year medical student at the Lagos State University College of Medicine, Ikeja, Lagos.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdksLC5zK6loqyZmsBwvsSloKChn6N8p7vRZqSuq5yeurR5wpqlZpmcoa6pecWoqaChppp6rsWMrKCnq1%2BpxXq3z5yi</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./houstons-silk-road-cuisine.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Houston's Silk Road Cuisine | TIME</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./alain-rousset-veut-un-deuxieme-plan-de-relance.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Alain Rousset veut un deuxime plan de relance</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./joe-biden-immigration-private-prisons.html>Biden Use of Private Migrant Centers Grows Amid Border Surge</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-often-should-you-replace-your-shoes.html>How Often Should You Replace Your Shoes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1550102-james-bond-actors-order-how-played-iconic-spy.html>James Bond actors in order: how many played the iconic spy?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./0-28804-1898067-1938106-1938103-00-html.html>Jeff Han - TIME 100 Roundtables</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-cnsa-adopte-sa-convention-socle-avec-les-departements.html>La CNSA adopte sa convention socle avec les dpartements</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogZ.
