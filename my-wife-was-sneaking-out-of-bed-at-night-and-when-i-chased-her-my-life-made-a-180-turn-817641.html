His wife of&nbsp;15&nbsp;years started to&nbsp;behave very strangely, sneaking out of&nbsp;the bed and the house in&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;the night. When he&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;chase her to&nbsp;see where she was going and what she was doing, he&nbsp;just couldn’t live peacefully with this truth anymore. The man revealed the details of&nbsp;his family drama, and we&nbsp;can’t but feel for him, as&nbsp;his story turned out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;very frustrating.</p><p><h2>The man has experienced some unexplainable issues in&nbsp;his family.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/587/46f/3155645621b77118b44dd4e952.jpg><p>A&nbsp;man named Austin has recently written a&nbsp;letter to&nbsp;our editorial to&nbsp;tell about his very strange family story. He&nbsp;wrote that during many years, he&nbsp;has had a&nbsp;necessity to&nbsp;get up&nbsp;at&nbsp;night to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;the bathroom. He&nbsp;explained that this is&nbsp;how his body has been functioning because of&nbsp;the problems with his bladder.</p><p>Austin has a&nbsp;wife, named Laura, to&nbsp;whom he’s been happily married for over 15&nbsp;years now, and Laura is&nbsp;aware of&nbsp;the fact that Austin has to&nbsp;wake up&nbsp;at&nbsp;night on&nbsp;a&nbsp;daily basis. Everything seemed ordinary, like in&nbsp;any other family, until Austin started noticing weird things. And his bladder was the reason why he&nbsp;ever paid attention to&nbsp;what was happening in&nbsp;the night.</p><p>Austin wrote that lately when he&nbsp;got&nbsp;up, he&nbsp;wouldn’t find his wife beside him in&nbsp;their bed. In&nbsp;fact, he&nbsp;couldn’t find her anywhere in&nbsp;the house. The man revealed that at&nbsp;first, he&nbsp;thought that maybe his spouse had some <a href=# title=anxiety data-link=tag>anxiety</a> and was going for a&nbsp;walk occasionally in&nbsp;the night, while her stress became bigger. He&nbsp;sincerely tried to&nbsp;find some explanations for this behavior, and at&nbsp;first he&nbsp;didn’t even ask many questions to&nbsp;Laura.</p><p>He&nbsp;wrote, “I&nbsp;thought she didn’t want to&nbsp;talk about her stress, and&nbsp;I was just patiently waiting for her to&nbsp;open&nbsp;up. I&nbsp;was sure that something was wrong, but&nbsp;I didn’t want to&nbsp;be&nbsp;persistent, because Laura has a&nbsp;very secretive personality, and I&nbsp;am used to&nbsp;the fact that if&nbsp;she doesn’t want to&nbsp;discuss something, it’s better to&nbsp;wait until she wants.”</p><p><h2>The situation in&nbsp;the family was getting really tense.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7c3/15d/2ede7456fd86ac8f14fb410780.jpg><p>Austin continues his story, saying that one night, when it&nbsp;happened again, he&nbsp;finally decided that he&nbsp;should know what was happening. He&nbsp;revealed that Laura would usually be&nbsp;back home from her “night walks” at&nbsp;around 5-6&nbsp;am, looking exhausted, nervous and sleepy. And when such things started happening too often to&nbsp;be&nbsp;acceptable, he&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;talk to&nbsp;his wife.</p><p>But she wouldn’t answer any of&nbsp;his questions. She just said that she was near their house all this time, and she actually didn’t go&nbsp;anywhere. She complained that the air in&nbsp;their room was stifling and at&nbsp;a&nbsp;certain point it&nbsp;was hard for her to&nbsp;breathe, so&nbsp;she just went out to&nbsp;take a&nbsp;gulp of&nbsp;fresh air.</p><p>Austin wrote, “I&nbsp;would have believed this if&nbsp;it&nbsp;happened occasionally, and if&nbsp;it&nbsp;wasn’t a&nbsp;cold and windy period of&nbsp;the year, when the air could not be&nbsp;stifling at&nbsp;all, and there was even too ‘fresh’ in&nbsp;our bedroom. Besides, I&nbsp;didn’t hear or&nbsp;know about any medical condition that Laura might have that would result in&nbsp;such symptoms every night. She has never had problems with her breathing, and when&nbsp;I asked her particularly about that, she denied that she needed to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;see a&nbsp;doctor about this.”</p><p>The man admitted that things were becoming more and more strange, when, apart from being absent for the most of&nbsp;the nights now, his wife was turning into a&nbsp;cold and reserved woman, rejecting any of&nbsp;his hugs, kisses and other signs of&nbsp;affection.</p><p>He&nbsp;wrote, “I&nbsp;started thinking about Laura’s infidelity and&nbsp;oh, man, I&nbsp;wish she’d been just cheating on&nbsp;me, because the real truth was far more painful.”</p><p><h2>The truth was revealed very unexpectedly.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/10c/510/14611f56edaa249c1f8b2aa1aa.jpg><p>Austin goes on&nbsp;with his story, saying that one day, he&nbsp;made a&nbsp;decision to&nbsp;chase his wife in&nbsp;the night to&nbsp;see where she would go&nbsp;and what she would&nbsp;do. He&nbsp;admitted that this was a&nbsp;quite painful decision for him, as&nbsp;he&nbsp;felt like something was wrong in&nbsp;their relationship if&nbsp;he&nbsp;ever thought about this kind of&nbsp;thing like chasing.</p><p>But, after all, he&nbsp;had no&nbsp;choice, because she wouldn’t tell him the truth and he&nbsp;wouldn’t just passively watch his wife turning into a&nbsp;completely strange person to&nbsp;him.</p><p>So, one night, he&nbsp;heard that Laura was leaving the bed. He&nbsp;waited until she got completely dressed for an&nbsp;outdoors walk, and quickly left the house 2&nbsp;minutes after she did. He&nbsp;followed her during all her route, and she didn’t even turn her head a&nbsp;single time to&nbsp;see if&nbsp;anyone was following her. This might have been because she was sure that he&nbsp;wouldn’t do&nbsp;this, and this was a&nbsp;habitual thing for her already.</p><p>Laura went on&nbsp;foot, and the road that she followed, was very familiar to&nbsp;Austin. In&nbsp;fact, she was slowly approaching the house of&nbsp;his parents, where they had lived together with his elder brother, Mike, his wife Amelia and their two kids, Dana and Ian.</p><p>Austin wrote, “I&nbsp;had a&nbsp;mixture of&nbsp;feelings at&nbsp;that moment when&nbsp;I saw Laura was going straight to&nbsp;my&nbsp;family’s house. On&nbsp;the one hand, I&nbsp;felt relieved, on&nbsp;the other hand, I&nbsp;had so&nbsp;many questions on&nbsp;why she visited my&nbsp;parents at&nbsp;night, not during the daytime and why she had been keeping it&nbsp;such a&nbsp;big secret.”</p><p><h2>The man was even more shocked when he&nbsp;saw what Laura was actually doing at&nbsp;her in-laws’.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c02/9e9/64e9515644b2e82e727fd72498.jpg><p>Austin wrote, “I&nbsp;followed her straight to&nbsp;my&nbsp;parents’ door, she didn’t knock or&nbsp;ring, she took her mobile phone and dialed a&nbsp;number. Then my&nbsp;older brother, Mike, silently appeared on&nbsp;the doorstep, took her hand, and they went to&nbsp;the <a href=# title=garden data-link=tag>garden</a> that was behind my&nbsp;parents’ house.”</p><p>The man was able to&nbsp;hide near enough to&nbsp;listen to&nbsp;what they were talking about. He&nbsp;wrote, “I&nbsp;had been growing up&nbsp;in&nbsp;that house and&nbsp;I knew my&nbsp;parents’ garden as&nbsp;good as&nbsp;my&nbsp;10&nbsp;fingers. I&nbsp;used to&nbsp;play hide-and-seek there with my&nbsp;school friends, when&nbsp;I was very young, and later, I&nbsp;dated Laura in&nbsp;that very same garden and even proposed to&nbsp;her on&nbsp;that very same bench where she was now sitting and talking to&nbsp;my&nbsp;brother.”</p><p>Austin goes&nbsp;on, saying, that Mike and Laura were discussing a&nbsp;child. In&nbsp;fact, it&nbsp;was Mike’s eldest daughter, Dana. He&nbsp;didn’t understand why his wife would be&nbsp;so&nbsp;interested in&nbsp;talking about Dana at&nbsp;night, but when he&nbsp;listened more, he&nbsp;understood the reason.</p><p>It&nbsp;turned out, that Dana was not his niece, but his wife’s daughter. She conceived her with his brother, Mike, and Austin wasn’t aware of&nbsp;this all this time. He&nbsp;did know that Dana was a&nbsp;child of&nbsp;Mike’s previous relationship with some woman, whom he&nbsp;never introduced to&nbsp;the family. And when Dana was born, he&nbsp;got the full custody of&nbsp;her, but he&nbsp;never told any details to&nbsp;the members of&nbsp;his family and never showed any documents to&nbsp;anyone.</p><p>No&nbsp;one insisted all this time on&nbsp;finding the details of&nbsp;Mike’s painful relationship, leaving it&nbsp;up&nbsp;to&nbsp;him to&nbsp;keep it&nbsp;a&nbsp;secret. Dana was a&nbsp;nice young lady, Mike and his wife Amelia loved her as&nbsp;much as&nbsp;their younger son, Ian, and there was a&nbsp;total idyll in&nbsp;their family.</p><p><h2>Austin talked to&nbsp;his wife in&nbsp;the morning and finally found out even more shocking details about her past and present.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d99/5d7/8b21935beebb78711dab9723bb.jpg><p>Austin made sure he&nbsp;came back home earlier than Laura, and pretended to&nbsp;be&nbsp;asleep when she came into the room. But she noticed that he&nbsp;had left his clothes just near their entrance door, which wasn’t typical for him, so&nbsp;she asked if&nbsp;he&nbsp;was really sleeping and why his clothes were left there. Austin felt it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;right time to&nbsp;talk and told Laura that he&nbsp;had found out everything, and said he&nbsp;had been following her and heard her talking to&nbsp;Mike.</p><p>Laura had no&nbsp;more reason to&nbsp;hide the real truth, so&nbsp;she told Austin that she and Mike had been dating for half a&nbsp;year in&nbsp;the past. Then, she fell pregnant, and thought Mike would be&nbsp;happy to&nbsp;marry her. But he&nbsp;accused her of&nbsp;baby-trapping him, and said that he&nbsp;hadn’t planned to&nbsp;ever marry her, but he&nbsp;really wanted to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;dad to&nbsp;the baby, so&nbsp;he&nbsp;insisted that she gave birth to&nbsp;Dana and then took a&nbsp;full custody of&nbsp;her.</p><p>When Austin and Laura started dating, Laura knew that Austin was Mike’s brother, but she sincerely fell in&nbsp;love with Austin and treasured their relationship. Austin had always been questioning why Laura was so&nbsp;reluctant to&nbsp;visit his parents, especially when Mike moved in&nbsp;with them some years ago. But he&nbsp;thought that was just because of&nbsp;the difference in&nbsp;their views of&nbsp;life, and had never insisted that Laura was in&nbsp;close relationship with her in-laws.</p><p>Now, Laura wanted to&nbsp;become a&nbsp;parent to&nbsp;Dana and was discussing with Mike the possibility of&nbsp;opening up&nbsp;to&nbsp;the girl. She and Austin never had kids, because Austin couldn’t have them. But Laura felt she still wanted to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;real mother to&nbsp;Dana and was meeting Mike for discussing this with him.</p><p>Now, Austin is&nbsp;both disappointed, sad and puzzled. The man really needs advice on&nbsp;how to&nbsp;live further with the knowledge that he&nbsp;now has, and he&nbsp;admitted that his life now is&nbsp;a&nbsp;total mess.</p><p><h2>We’d advise Austin to&nbsp;talk to&nbsp;everyone, who’s involved into this dramatic story.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e79/4ba/f7a6365685a50f0a5f63b7ee77.jpg><p>We&nbsp;sincerely feel for Austin, and we&nbsp;can imagine how hard it&nbsp;is&nbsp;for him to&nbsp;get over the things he&nbsp;discovered. But past sometimes shouldn’t be&nbsp;a&nbsp;reason why the present and future get affected.</p><p>We’d advise the man to&nbsp;wait until his emotions get stable, and then we&nbsp;think he&nbsp;should sit and talk to&nbsp;Laura again. But this time, the subject of&nbsp;their talk should not be&nbsp;“Who’s guilty?”, but “What to&nbsp;do?”</p><p>The spouses might want to&nbsp;take further steps in&nbsp;the process of&nbsp;getting custody over Dana, but they must consider the opinion of&nbsp;Mike, his wife and the girl also. So, it’s really vital for Austin to&nbsp;contact all people who are involved and to&nbsp;try to&nbsp;find the common family solution that wouldn’t hurt anyone’s feelings.</p><p>We&nbsp;understand that this solution will take time to&nbsp;find, but finally, the result may be&nbsp;unexpectedly good for everyone, provided that all members of&nbsp;the incident take care of&nbsp;Dana’s feelings in&nbsp;the first place, as&nbsp;she’s a&nbsp;kid and she’s the core of&nbsp;the whole story.</p><p>And here’s yet another mysterious story about a&nbsp;woman who found a&nbsp;<a href=#>tampon</a> in&nbsp;her boyfriend’s room and managed to&nbsp;check if&nbsp;he&nbsp;was cheating on&nbsp;her, with the help of&nbsp;this hygienic thingie.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLq6edainZ5lp5bAbr%2FNnpikoZ6cerDB02amn2WSmrFurdNmpaKfmKl6orrDZq6hnZ5itm6vx5qqnpxdnbKzecyyZKWhlpp6rq3DnmSaZWFtfW7A1KulZnBhbIN1fY4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./people-share-17-embarrassing-situations-that-happened-in-public-806360.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>People Share 17 Embarrassing Situations That Happened in Public</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./maks-chmerkovskiy-so-you-think-you-can-dance-judge-dwts-1235925977.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Maks Chmerkovskiy on Joining So You Think You Can Dance After Years of Challenging Judge</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./joe-biden-immigration-private-prisons.html>Biden Use of Private Migrant Centers Grows Amid Border Surge</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-often-should-you-replace-your-shoes.html>How Often Should You Replace Your Shoes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1550102-james-bond-actors-order-how-played-iconic-spy.html>James Bond actors in order: how many played the iconic spy?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./0-28804-1898067-1938106-1938103-00-html.html>Jeff Han - TIME 100 Roundtables</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-cnsa-adopte-sa-convention-socle-avec-les-departements.html>La CNSA adopte sa convention socle avec les dpartements</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogZ.
