Dad was known for playing the drums and being quite musical, and one day John asks him whether he’d like to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the drummer in&nbsp;a&nbsp;band he’s forming. Dad was keen, but my&nbsp;granny said he&nbsp;needed to&nbsp;prioritize studying, and so&nbsp;he&nbsp;didn’t join.<br>The band formed and were called <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>The Quarrymen</a>, and&nbsp;I think a&nbsp;guy called Colin was the drummer instead of&nbsp;dad, who&nbsp;I believe was later replaced by&nbsp;Pete Best and then Ringo, as&nbsp;they changed to&nbsp;The Silver Beatles, and then The Beatles.<br>I&nbsp;like to&nbsp;imagine that in&nbsp;an&nbsp;alternative universe, my&nbsp;dad said yes and that was history. I&nbsp;don’t even mind that&nbsp;I wouldn’t have been born if&nbsp;this had been the outcome&nbsp;— he&nbsp;really deserved to&nbsp;have had that lifetime.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;Unknown user&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><ul><li>A&nbsp;few years ago, I’d go&nbsp;to&nbsp;college in&nbsp;the morning and leave at&nbsp;about midnight because&nbsp;I didn’t have a&nbsp;computer and needed to&nbsp;work on&nbsp;homework at&nbsp;school. One time on&nbsp;the last train ride home, there was this guy acting a&nbsp;bit strange the whole ride. He&nbsp;gets up&nbsp;and stands in&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;the car and, as&nbsp;the train brakes coming into the station, he&nbsp;falls flat on&nbsp;his face from a&nbsp;full standing position, lays there until the trains stops, stands&nbsp;up, dusts himself off and walks out of&nbsp;the open doors like nothing happened.<br>I&nbsp;saw him doing it&nbsp;like 5&nbsp;other separate times and since&nbsp;I was used to&nbsp;it&nbsp;at&nbsp;that point&nbsp;I enjoyed looking out for the uninitiated riders’ reactions. I&nbsp;really enjoyed the entertainment.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;Pinestachio&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><ul><li>When my&nbsp;mom was pregnant with&nbsp;me, she and my&nbsp;father divorced, and he&nbsp;gave up&nbsp;all parental rights. I’ve never met him or&nbsp;spoken to&nbsp;him, I’ve only seen a&nbsp;few pictures. About 2&nbsp;years ago, I&nbsp;worked at&nbsp;a&nbsp;healthcare facility where&nbsp;I would float to&nbsp;different offices around the county based on&nbsp;who needed the help. This one particular morning&nbsp;I was checking the doctor’s schedule and saw my&nbsp;father’s name. He&nbsp;was scheduled to&nbsp;be&nbsp;in&nbsp;the office next door to&nbsp;where&nbsp;I was working, and&nbsp;I thought it&nbsp;was pretty crazy, but&nbsp;I most likely wouldn’t even see him.<br>The time of&nbsp;his appointment came, and he&nbsp;walked into my&nbsp;office straight up&nbsp;to&nbsp;me&nbsp;and says he&nbsp;had a&nbsp;doctor’s appointment with Dr&nbsp;X. My&nbsp;heart was racing because&nbsp;I knew it&nbsp;was him as&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;he&nbsp;walked through the door. I&nbsp;told him Dr&nbsp;X&nbsp;was the office next door and he&nbsp;left. A&nbsp;little while later&nbsp;I walked over to&nbsp;the other office to&nbsp;deliver some faxes and on&nbsp;my&nbsp;way out he&nbsp;trailed behind me&nbsp;and&nbsp;I held the door for him. He&nbsp;said thank you. And that was my&nbsp;one and only interaction with my&nbsp;father in&nbsp;my&nbsp;30&nbsp;years of&nbsp;living.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;t***waffle53&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/536/993/4c45635f9db6fcc645b561734d.jpg><ul><li>I&nbsp;(26) am&nbsp;adopted. I&nbsp;have nothing to&nbsp;do&nbsp;with my&nbsp;biological family, save for a&nbsp;half brother, who&nbsp;I reconnected with last year. We’re friends on&nbsp;<a href=# title=Facebook data-link=tag>Facebook</a>.<br>About a&nbsp;year and a&nbsp;half ago, I&nbsp;spent 6&nbsp;months as&nbsp;a&nbsp;pizza delivery driver. While there, I&nbsp;met a&nbsp;man, probably in&nbsp;his 50s or&nbsp;so. We&nbsp;got along. I&nbsp;quit the job 6&nbsp;months&nbsp;in, but a&nbsp;couple months ago&nbsp;I came back, and the guy is&nbsp;still there.<br>A&nbsp;week ago, my&nbsp;brother tags me&nbsp;on&nbsp;Facebook, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;my&nbsp;co-worker. A&nbsp;few days later, I&nbsp;ask my&nbsp;co-worker how he&nbsp;knows my&nbsp;brother. After a&nbsp;misunderstanding (my&nbsp;brother has the same name as&nbsp;his father, so&nbsp;when I&nbsp;asked, he&nbsp;thought&nbsp;I was talking about my&nbsp;brother’s father), we&nbsp;found out that the co-worker is&nbsp;actually my&nbsp;uncle by&nbsp;marriage. Or&nbsp;was. He&nbsp;was married to&nbsp;my&nbsp;biological mom’s sister for some 20&nbsp;years, until they divorced a&nbsp;couple years ago.<br>The guy used to&nbsp;babysit me&nbsp;when&nbsp;I was a&nbsp;baby, and has pictures of&nbsp;my&nbsp;brother and biological mom that he&nbsp;gave&nbsp;me.

I&nbsp;was doing the run-up in&nbsp;a&nbsp;Cessna, when&nbsp;I smelt something. “Do&nbsp;you smell that? Smells like gas,” I&nbsp;say. The instructor, who’s 21&nbsp;years-old, shrugs. Annoyed, I&nbsp;open the door, and there is&nbsp;a&nbsp;spreading puddle of&nbsp;Av-gas under the plane.<br>The instructor panics, “Stay in&nbsp;the plane, I’ll get help!” and runs off. As&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;I got the engine off, I&nbsp;got out of&nbsp;there, and watched the plane dump all its fuel on&nbsp;the runway. They kindly gave me&nbsp;another plane, and instructor. They “fixed” their plane, and a&nbsp;month later, I&nbsp;read about the same plane getting into an&nbsp;accident due to&nbsp;fuel issues.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;The-Sound_of-Silence&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><ul><li>Me&nbsp;and my&nbsp;friend were bored and decided to&nbsp;go&nbsp;skating at&nbsp;like 1am and ended up&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;car park.

All of&nbsp;a&nbsp;sudden, heading home, I&nbsp;see traffic on&nbsp;the opposite lane stopped for some reason. What I&nbsp;immediately saw next, I&nbsp;was not prepared for.

And it’s not like the country&nbsp;I live in&nbsp;is&nbsp;habitat to&nbsp;any ostriches.<br>Slowly, I&nbsp;follow the ostrich, which is&nbsp;running after the car ahead, faced with a&nbsp;decision: do&nbsp;I overtake the ostrich? Now I’m no&nbsp;expert on&nbsp;ostriches, but I&nbsp;do remember reading that ostriches run really quickly, and that they can be&nbsp;aggressive towards humans. I&nbsp;don’t want to&nbsp;become the victim of&nbsp;an&nbsp;ostrich attack, but I&nbsp;do want to&nbsp;get home quickly, as&nbsp;it&nbsp;was starting to&nbsp;get dark.<br>After hesitating for a&nbsp;while, I&nbsp;gave it&nbsp;all&nbsp;I had and overtook the ostrich.
