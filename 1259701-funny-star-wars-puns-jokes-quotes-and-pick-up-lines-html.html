Since then, it has become a pop culture phenomenon, with more and more people observing the galactic adventures of the lovable main characters. Of course, over the years, there has been a lot of franchise-related jokes circulating all around the internet.</p><h2>Best Star Wars jokes: puns, pick up lines and many more</h2><p class=align-left>Here is a collection of the funniest, cutest and most memorable lines that either the Star Wars canon or its fandom brought us. We will start with the hilarious puns!</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/9532d0333713e062.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 weird outdoor advertisements you can only found in Nigeria</span></p></a><h3>Star Wars puns</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/9532d0333713e062.png><p class=align-left>Usually, some of the significant words and names of the characters are used to create a hilarious pun. You can check out some of the best picks.</p><ul><li><strong>Force: </strong>The famous quote "May the Force be with you" became a reason why May the fourth is now celebrated as Star Wars Day among fans. This is probably the best-known pun, as it is a direct wordplay on May the fourth, and its first use dates back to this date in 1979 when Margaret Thatcher became a Prime Minister of the UK. The Conservatives congratulated her through the London Evening News, placing an advertisement in the newspaper which said "May the Fourth Be with You, Maggie. Congratulations".</li><li><strong>Sith: </strong>May the Fourth is not the only day when fans celebrate their devotion to the franchise. Sometimes, the following day is seen by the fan base as "Revenge of the Fifth," which is a play on "Revenge of the Sith" - the third episode of Star Wars. On this day, fans typically give more attention to the villains of the saga, such as Sith Lords. However, there is a common disagreement about this holiday. Some admirers prefer to celebrate on May the sixth, claiming that "Revenge of the Sixth" is a better pun.</li><li><strong>War: </strong>Some people replace the common phrases that contain the word "war" with "Star Wars." For example, "All's fair in love and Star Wars."</li><li><strong>Leia: </strong>The name of the famous princess can be used as a replacement for "lay," "lay a" or "later." For example, "Do not Leia hand on me" or "Sooner or Leia."</li><li><strong>Luke: </strong>The protagonist's name is so versatile that it could replace a lot of words. Some examples are "look" and "luck." For instance, "Luke on the bright side" or "Better Luke next time."</li><li><strong>Wookiee: </strong>The Wookiee species, especially Chewbacca, won the hearts of many people. The word rhymes with "cookie" and "rookie," so you can say "a Wookiee jar" or "a Wookiee mistake."</li><li><strong>Yoda: </strong>The wise Jedi Master has a name that may give associations with "soda" and "yoga." You can also make a pun on the car brand Toyota, saying "Toyoda."</li><li><strong>Han: </strong>The rebellious Han Solo's name can be used for puns on "hand" or "hen," such as "all Hans on deck" or "Mother Han."</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f2f70f7e32c61924.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>30 of the best Doctor Who quotes that prove why the show is iconic</span></p></a><p class=align-left>If you activate some creativity and imagination, you can create some Star Wars funny puns from the name of basically any character in the franchise!

He makes light fun of Luke by asking him how he got so big eating small food. It is also funny because Yoda himself is small.</p><ul><li>"Same as always…" - Luke Skywalker, "Return of the Jedi"</li></ul><p class=align-left>This line is worth mentioning because the whole scene is hilarious. Han asks Luke how he is doing, to which Luke replies "same as always...", and Han concludes with "that bad, huh?". The reason why we love the franchise is not just exciting adventures, but also the humorous dialogue exchanges.</p><ul><li>"You came in that thing?

Even in the most dangerous situations when they have to run for their lives, Leia still makes fun of Han.</p><ul><li>"Who's scruffy-looking?" - Han Solo, "The Empire Strikes Back"</li></ul><p class=align-left>Out of all the insults listed by Leia, being called "scruffy-looking" gets to Han the most. He is not the type of guy who is used to mocking when it comes to his appearance. The way he says this is a notable example of witty Star Wars funny quotes.</p><ul><li>"Shutting up, sir" - C-3PO, "A New Hope."</li></ul><p class=align-left>This classic joke occurs when Uncle Owen strictly tells C-3PO to shut up, and the robot takes this order too literally, saying "shutting up, sir."</p><p class=align-left>There are many more funny lines in the franchise which we all remember with a smile.</p><h3>Star Wars pickup lines</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f86a7528f9aa1537.png><p class=align-left>Do you want to hit on a guy or a girl who loves Star Wars as much as you do?
