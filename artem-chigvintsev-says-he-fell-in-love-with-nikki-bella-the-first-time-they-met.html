The WWE veterans started out the episode by talking about their recent Thanksgiving holiday. Eventually, they moved on to Chigvintsev and Dancing With the Stars, where the couple first met.</strong></p><p>Now that the DWTS season is over, Chigvintsev has returned to living with his family. Their <a href=#>son, Matteo,</a> is definitely happy to have his father home and out of the DWTS quarantine bubble. The couple shared that although Bella was able to visit him on set, Matteo was too young to understand his dad being away from them.</p><p>The couple told the story of how their son walked Chigvintsev around the house excited to show him everything once he was finally home. Although the professional dancer was unable to be with his family during the show, Nikki brought Matteo to the <a href=#>AGT: Extreme</a> set where she is a judge.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Artem and Nikki: Love at First Body Slam?</h2><p>After touching up on the DWTS season, the Bellas asked Chigvintsev questions from fans. Nikki asked what Chigvintsev’s favorite memory of them together was. Let me just say, I think this was the cutest response I’ve ever heard. He brought us back to the beginning of <a href=#>DWTS Season 25</a> where he was first partnered with Nikki.</p><p>“Favorite memory of us, well obviously I know I mean Nicole might feel a little different, but to me, just the meeting, I think that was the one thing that tripped me out. I know it’s very controversial, but I think meeting Nicole for the first time,” said Chigvintsev. “I called the executive producer [of DWTS] right after our first meet. I said that I think I’m like in love. When you meet the certain person that you don’t really understand how you feel yet, you have this overwhelming a lot of feelings. That was the time when it hit me.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Nikki then shared that her favorite memory was body slamming her soon-to-be hubby. For her Dancing With the Stars entrance, the two wanted the WWE star to do her normal walk-on routine. The producers loved it and even asked her to throw him around. The original entrance was never aired on DWTS. WWE wanted something bigger and better for the show, so they filmed the package at WWE’s Monday Night RAW.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-when-will-the-two-tie-the-knot>When Will the Two Tie the Knot?</h2><p>Nikki and Chigvintsev planned to marry over the recent Thanksgiving holiday weekend. Unfortunately, there’s been a slight change in plans due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>“It’s so funny because I always picked Thanksgiving because we’re in the entertainment industry,” Nikki <a href=#>said</a>. “I’m like, ‘OK, Dancing With the Stars is done, in Hollywood, no one ever works Thanksgiving weekend.’ And for Artem, he’s just mainly like, ‘I just want my parents there.'”</p><p>Chigvintsev was born in Russia and moved to the United States in 2003 to pursue his love of dance. Since his family is in Russia, travel to the U.S. while Covid-19 variants continue to increase would be difficult. A wedding date will be set once the Chigvintsev family is once again able to travel.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/GettyImages-1209191152.jpg alt="Ken Jeong Tells People to ‘Be Kind’ Amid Covid-19 Omicron Variant" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wKurnqVdmLWqs9Wipa2rlat6tK3YrGShnV2bsq24jKKlZqSfq7Juw8itn2ammaC4qnnBnqOlmV2ptaZ5xaKprKxdqbausYytn56xXaKytXs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-witcher-season-3-part-1-ending.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Breaking Down 'The Witcher' Mid-Season 3 Cliffhanger Ending</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./american-born-chinese-canceled-disney-plus-1235862458.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>American Born Chinese Canceled After One Season at Disney+</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./joe-biden-immigration-private-prisons.html>Biden Use of Private Migrant Centers Grows Amid Border Surge</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-often-should-you-replace-your-shoes.html>How Often Should You Replace Your Shoes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1550102-james-bond-actors-order-how-played-iconic-spy.html>James Bond actors in order: how many played the iconic spy?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./0-28804-1898067-1938106-1938103-00-html.html>Jeff Han - TIME 100 Roundtables</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-cnsa-adopte-sa-convention-socle-avec-les-departements.html>La CNSA adopte sa convention socle avec les dpartements</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogZ.
