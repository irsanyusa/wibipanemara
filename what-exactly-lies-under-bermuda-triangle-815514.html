The city of&nbsp;Atlantis allegedly existed 12,000 years ago. Then it&nbsp;sank, and over centuries, people have been passing stories about&nbsp;it. Many think it&nbsp;was just a&nbsp;regular island.</p><p>But so&nbsp;many legends tell about a&nbsp;powerful empire. Atlantis supposedly was one of&nbsp;the wealthiest and most fascinating cities of&nbsp;its time. Your breath would have been taken away if&nbsp;you had stepped through its central gate. Amazing decorations and towering marble statues were all over the place.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/1e6/5cf/991a3c5efea8bab2757059c297.png><p>The rumor has it&nbsp;the entire city is&nbsp;under the water now. Some people believe that it’s on&nbsp;the seabed somewhere in&nbsp;the Bermuda triangle. Some even claim that an&nbsp;underwater pyramid in&nbsp;the Atlantic is&nbsp;somehow responsible for all those planes, people, and boats that mysteriously disappear there&nbsp;— and no&nbsp;one can track them later.</p><p>The story says that in&nbsp;the late 1960s, there was a&nbsp;group of&nbsp;treasure hunters that came across the ruins of&nbsp;an&nbsp;ancient city. It&nbsp;happened during one of&nbsp;their diving expeditions in&nbsp;the Bermuda region off the coast of&nbsp;Miami. They spoke about the intriguing remains of&nbsp;the city and mentioned a&nbsp;glass pyramid they also stumbled upon there. They claimed it&nbsp;was bigger than any other pyramid, even those discovered in&nbsp;<a href=# title=Egypt data-link=tag>Egypt</a>. Of&nbsp;course, those were just stories.</p><p>But unusual things&nbsp;DO happen in&nbsp;that area&nbsp;— for example, volatile water currents or&nbsp;a&nbsp;strong vortex that occurs from time to&nbsp;time. The Bermuda triangle is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the best spots for researchers to&nbsp;explore. They go&nbsp;there to&nbsp;study minerals, the seabed, and the Gulf Stream. They study how the ocean influences weather. The geological structure of&nbsp;the planet’s crust deep down under the ocean floor is&nbsp;especially interesting.</p><p>The deepest point in&nbsp;the Atlantic Ocean [the Milwaukee Deep] lies in&nbsp;the Bermuda triangle. Researchers have done a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;studies and drilling there to&nbsp;find out what lies a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;miles beneath the seabed in&nbsp;that area. There’s an&nbsp;awesome variety of&nbsp;seabed landforms in&nbsp;the Bermuda triangle. You can hardly see anything like that anywhere else on&nbsp;Earth&nbsp;— especially if&nbsp;you keep in&nbsp;mind that this is&nbsp;a&nbsp;relatively small ocean region.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/726/790/5edbc7517b8a9ce1c8a38f425b.png><p>Look at&nbsp;this shelf with shallow banks! There are also plateaus, plains, and deep sea trenches. If&nbsp;you believe the Bermuda triangle is&nbsp;some sort of&nbsp;a&nbsp;trap, you’re not wrong, considering its complex geological structure. There are a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;groups of&nbsp;seamounts in&nbsp;the eastern and northern regions of&nbsp;the triangle. They’re mostly unnamed.</p><p>Some of&nbsp;them are up&nbsp;to&nbsp;650 feet high. At&nbsp;such heights, they would be&nbsp;considered regular hills on&nbsp;the surface. But by&nbsp;ocean standards, these so-called underwater hills are like small mountains. They’re either elliptical or&nbsp;round. You can see that if&nbsp;you take a&nbsp;look from above. There are more seamounts in&nbsp;the Pacific [10,000] than in&nbsp;the Atlantic Ocean [600].</p><p>The underwater world in&nbsp;the Atlantic is&nbsp;less diverse than in&nbsp;the Pacific&nbsp;— unless we’re talking about the Bermuda triangle. The limestone platform that forms the bottom of&nbsp;the triangle is&nbsp;nearly 3.7 miles deep. And this entire thick layer consists of&nbsp;the remains of&nbsp;small ancient creatures.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/889/982/c250065ae9912cc8d27ace5582.png><p>In&nbsp;2019, a&nbsp;big group of&nbsp;geologists published an&nbsp;article where they claimed that the triangle formed as&nbsp;a&nbsp;result of&nbsp;strong volcanic activity. For years, people believed there were ancient long-extinct volcanoes that brought the Bermuda islands from the sea bottom. So, one theory says the Bermuda islands formed because there were disruptions in&nbsp;magma flows.</p><p>Pieces of&nbsp;ancient plates that were already in&nbsp;the mantle went up&nbsp;to&nbsp;the surface. And then they mixed. That’s how many volcanic islands in&nbsp;the oceans could form. Knowing this, science fiction writers let their imagination run wild. They told stories about scary creatures and mystical cities&nbsp;— or&nbsp;islands&nbsp;— hidden deep down beneath all those layers.</p><p>All these mysterious stories encourage people to&nbsp;create their own theories. In&nbsp;the 15th century, a&nbsp;well-known man named Christopher Columbus was on&nbsp;what would later become one of&nbsp;the greatest and most important expeditions ever. He&nbsp;was one of&nbsp;the first people to&nbsp;tell stories about a&nbsp;mysterious region that was later called the Bermuda triangle.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/b40/916/b47273599c86ed5cc6359bc734.png><p>This area was first known as&nbsp;the Sommers Isles&nbsp;— named after British naval hero and privateer George Sommers. But Spanish explorer Juan de&nbsp;Bermudez discovered the island in&nbsp;1505&nbsp;— and that’s when the area got the name it&nbsp;has today. So, Columbus mentioned some pretty strange sightings within the area, starting with a&nbsp;light similar to&nbsp;that of&nbsp;a&nbsp;candle, moving up&nbsp;and down in&nbsp;the distance. He&nbsp;immediately warned his crew and asked them to&nbsp;look at&nbsp;the light, which kept vanishing and reappearing.</p><p>He&nbsp;spoke about stars that seemed to&nbsp;move around in&nbsp;the sky. The needle of&nbsp;their compass went crazy too. But the most unusual thing he&nbsp;claimed he&nbsp;had seen was an&nbsp;unknown glowing object coming out of&nbsp;the sea and shooting toward the sky. Many people these days believe there was nothing really unusual there. Those must have been lights coming from another ship or&nbsp;from the shore. But Bermuda intrigues&nbsp;us today, too.</p><p>It’s a&nbsp;roughly triangular area where ships disappear without any trace. Sometimes they show up&nbsp;later but empty and with not a&nbsp;single person on&nbsp;board. But more often, no&nbsp;one ever finds their wrecks. And it’s not just ships; planes go&nbsp;missing too. The training sailing ship HMS Atalanta was one of&nbsp;the first cases in&nbsp;the string of&nbsp;mysteries of&nbsp;the Bermuda triangle.</p><p>The ship left a&nbsp;dockyard in&nbsp;Bermuda and headed in&nbsp;the direction of&nbsp;England back in&nbsp;1880. It&nbsp;never reached the British Isles. It&nbsp;actually never even left the Bermuda region. It&nbsp;just went missing, and no&nbsp;one ever found any trace of&nbsp;it. Some said the ship disappeared because of&nbsp;a&nbsp;powerful storm they came across on&nbsp;their route. The crew members probably didn’t have enough experience to&nbsp;handle such a&nbsp;situation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/6f3/0c9/43f2f65d1a853b71b721f53273.png><p>Back then, everyone wanted to&nbsp;know what had happened to&nbsp;the ship. How could it&nbsp;disappear just like that? It&nbsp;made headlines. People were coming up&nbsp;with all kinds of&nbsp;possible theories about what could have happened. The story continued with the coal carrier Cyclops. In&nbsp;1918, it&nbsp;sailed off the island of&nbsp;Barbados, and after a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;days, the situation repeated&nbsp;— the ship disappeared without a&nbsp;trace, along with more than 300 people on&nbsp;board.</p><p>Three years later, in&nbsp;1921, a&nbsp;coast guard on&nbsp;the Diamond Shoals near Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, discovered a&nbsp;massive commercial ship that ran aground. The guard was prepared to&nbsp;help people in&nbsp;trouble. But they had no&nbsp;one to&nbsp;save. The ship was empty. None of&nbsp;the passengers or&nbsp;crew members were there. Some theories about this accident included pirates, but... No&nbsp;one really found out what had happened.</p><p>Flight 19&nbsp;turned out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the most famous incidents in&nbsp;that area. An&nbsp;entire group of&nbsp;aircraft disappeared in&nbsp;the area in&nbsp;1945. A&nbsp;further rescue expedition didn’t go&nbsp;well either because one of&nbsp;the mariners with 13&nbsp;crew members also went missing. And it’s not that such things only happened a&nbsp;long time ago. A&nbsp;29-foot-long ship with 20&nbsp;people on&nbsp;board went missing a&nbsp;day after it&nbsp;was due to&nbsp;arrive at&nbsp;Lake Worth, Florida. There were neither any records of&nbsp;the ship nor any distress signal.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/27c/7a5/f8043455248cac3d9d6b7b00a8.png><p>The search mission involved boats and aircraft and lasted 84&nbsp;hours. The rescue team covered an&nbsp;area that was nearly two times the size of&nbsp;the entire state of&nbsp;Massachusetts [17,000 square miles], but still nothing. The Bermuda triangle is&nbsp;a&nbsp;place of&nbsp;great mystery, but the islands are a&nbsp;perfect spot for travelers. It’s an&nbsp;excellent place if&nbsp;you’re into golfing, for example.</p><p>So, if&nbsp;you’re lucky, you might easily run into some famous golf players or&nbsp;celebrities while there. And here’s something interesting for music fans&nbsp;— John Lennon got inspiration for nearly 25&nbsp;of&nbsp;his songs on&nbsp;one of&nbsp;these fascinating islands.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMSprdNmnLGZk6m5unnLopysZaWjsaa%2BjJucq6Wlma5uwNGimKefnJp6eX2UbmhtZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./alain-rousset-veut-un-deuxieme-plan-de-relance.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Alain Rousset veut un deuxime plan de relance</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./theo-james.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Theo James (Actor) - On This Day</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./joe-biden-immigration-private-prisons.html>Biden Use of Private Migrant Centers Grows Amid Border Surge</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-often-should-you-replace-your-shoes.html>How Often Should You Replace Your Shoes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1550102-james-bond-actors-order-how-played-iconic-spy.html>James Bond actors in order: how many played the iconic spy?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./0-28804-1898067-1938106-1938103-00-html.html>Jeff Han - TIME 100 Roundtables</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-cnsa-adopte-sa-convention-socle-avec-les-departements.html>La CNSA adopte sa convention socle avec les dpartements</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogZ.
