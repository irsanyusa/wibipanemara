Well, there’s quite a range of options available. First and foremost, in Italian, ‘I like’ doesn’t translate literally. To make things easier for English-speaking <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">students</a>, it is best to think of it as in ‘X thing/person/situation is pleasing <strong>to me</strong>’.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, to say ‘I like’ in Italian, you use the verb piacere (literally to like), but in its <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">reflexive</a> form.</p><p>So, get ready to cover it all: from the most useful piacere conjugations, passing by the use of reflexive pronouns, to alternative and colorful ways to express how you like your gelato or compliment a friend on their new haircut!</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=To-like-vs.-piacere>To like vs. piacere</h2><p>To convey that you enjoyed something in Italian, you use the verb piacere (to like). However, where in English the subject of the sentence ‘I like reading books’ performs the action of ‘liking’ something; in Italian, it is the object of your liking that becomes the subject and the ‘liking’ action is rather directed to someone, instead of being the action in itself.</p><p>Let’s clarify this with a few examples:</p><ul><li>I like pizza – The subject ‘I’ does the ‘liking’ of an object. In this case, pizza.</li><li><strong>Mi</strong> piace la pizza – The pizza, in this case, is the subject and it is the pizza that is appealing<strong> to me</strong></li></ul><p>Or</p><ul><li>They like traveling – The subject ‘they’ do the ‘liking’ of the action of traveling.</li><li><strong>A loro/Gli</strong> piace viaggiare – Grammatically, viaggiare (to travel) is the subject, what is appealing <strong>to them</strong>.</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=I-like-reflexive-pronouns>I like reflexive pronouns</h2><p>So learning how to say ‘I like’ in Italian entails a partial understanding of how the verb piacere works in its reflexive form. To start, let’s have a look at what the reflexive pronouns that accompany this verb are:&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table class=has-fixed-layout><tbody><tr><td><strong>English</strong></td><td><strong>Italian (atonic)</strong></td><td><strong>Italian (tonic)</strong></td></tr><tr><td>To me</td><td>Mi</td><td>A me</td></tr><tr><td>To you</td><td>Ti</td><td>A te</td></tr><tr><td>To him/her/it</td><td>Gli (masc.) or<br>le (fem.)</td><td>A lui/A lei</td></tr><tr><td>To us</td><td>Ci</td><td>A noi</td></tr><tr><td>To you</td><td>Vi&nbsp;</td><td>A voi</td></tr><tr><td>To them</td><td>Gli</td><td>A loro</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><p>Atonic and tonic <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">indirect object pronouns</a> do not differ in their function. Only, when using tonic ones, you will stress the emphasis on someone specific being the object rather than something/somebody else.</p><ul><li><strong>Ci </strong>piacciono i tatuaggi che hai sul braccio – We like the tattoos on your arm</li><li><strong>A noi </strong>piacciono i tatuaggi che hai sul braccio (slight emphasis on the fact us, and only us like the tattoos).</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=How-to-say-‘I-like’-in-Italian>How to say ‘I like’ in Italian</h2><p>Here is a summary of how you would <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">conjugate the verb</a> piacere along with the right reflective pronouns.</p><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table class=has-fixed-layout><tbody readability=4><tr readability=4><td><strong>English</strong></td><td><strong>Italian – Singular subject</strong></td><td><strong>Italian – Plural subject</strong></td></tr><tr><td>I like</td><td>Mi piace</td><td>Mi piacciono</td></tr><tr><td>You like</td><td>Ti piace</td><td>Ti piacciono</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>He/she/it likes</td><td>Gli piace (masc.)<br>Le piace (fem.)</td><td>Gli piacciono (masc.)<br>Le piacciono (fem.)</td></tr><tr><td>We like</td><td>Ci piace</td><td>Ci piacciono</td></tr><tr><td>You like</td><td>Vi piace</td><td>Vi piacciono</td></tr><tr><td>They like</td><td>Gli piace&nbsp;</td><td>Gli piacciono&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>Notice&nbsp;that the verb takes only two forms – third-person singular and first-person plural. This is because of the reverse order of the Italian structure compared to the English one.</p><p>In Italian, the subject that appeals to one can only vary within those two quantities and persons. Hence, the verb will follow along with the same qualities the subject displays.</p><p>The pronoun before the verb indicates to whom something is appealing.&nbsp;</p><p>Consider the examples below:</p><p>Mi piacciono i film dell’orrore – I like horror movies</p><p><strong>Breakdown</strong>:</p><ul><li>‘Horror movies’ are plural → this triggers the verb, in Italian, to be plural</li><li>The subject in English ‘I’ turns into the indirect object → to whom are movies appealing? To me. ‘To me’ in Italian translates with ‘mi’ and precedes the verb piacere.</li></ul><p>Or</p><p>Gli piace il colore rosa – They like the color pink</p><p><strong>Breakdown:</strong></p><ul><li>‘The color pink’ is singular → this triggers the verb, in Italian, to be singular too</li><li>The subject in English ‘they’ turns into the indirect object → to whom is the color pink appealing? To them. ‘To them’ in Italian translates with ‘gli’ and precedes the verb piacere.</li></ul><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Asking the question</h3><p>It’s all good and well to know how to share your opinion on things you enjoy. But to keep the conversation going, you need to know how to throw some questions back to your counterpart.</p><p>In Italian, yes/no questions are usually marked by intonation rather than by structure. This means that “Do you like the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">song</a>?” and “You like the song” maintain the same word order in Italian, and you differentiate the two sentences using your voice:</p><ul><li>Ti piace la canzone (affermative) – the pronunciation of the whole sentence remains quite flat</li><li>Ti piace la canzone? (yes/no interrogative) – toward the end of the question, the intonation raises</li></ul><p>If you wish to ask an open question, the structure changes too:</p><ul><li>Which song do you like?</li></ul><p>Che canzone ti piace?</p><p>Quali colori <strong>ti</strong> piacciono? (sing)</p><p>or&nbsp;</p><p>Quali colori <strong>vi</strong> piacciono? (plur)</p><p>The order, in this case, would be as follows:&nbsp;</p><p>W word + subject (what is appealing to someone) + reflexive pronoun (who is the subject appealing to?) + verb declined according to the subject (singular or plural).</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Explicit the subject</h3><p>So far, we mainly used the verb piacere with pronouns, to elicit the indirect object to whom something is appealing. If you want to use a noun, instead, you will need to ensure to add the preposition ‘a’ (to) before.</p><ul><li>Chiara likes her pasta al dente</li><li><strong>A Chiara</strong> piace la pasta al dente</li></ul><p>Building on everything we covered in this article, the example above should clarify even more how the Italian construction to say “I like” works. Pasta al dente is what is appealing<strong> to Chiara</strong>.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>The negative forms</h3><p>All is well when you love something, but how do you express that that movie wasn’t as good or that dish didn’t meet your expectations?</p><p>In Italian to say you dislike something, you can simply add the negative particle “non” before the reflexive pronoun.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Non</strong> ci piace il vostro tono – We dont’t like your tone</li><li><strong>Non </strong>le piacciono le persone disordinate – She doesn’t like messy people</li></ul><p>In case of an explicit subject, the negative particle “non” is added between the subject and the verb.</p><ul><li>A Luca<strong> non</strong> piace la Formula 1 – Luca doesn’t like Formula 1</li><li>Al mio capo <strong>non</strong> piacciono i ritardi – My boss doesn’t like lateness</li></ul><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=6-alternatives-to-say-I-like-in-Italian>6 alternatives to say I like in Italian</h2><p>We analyzed and broke down the formula to express what delights you in Italian. As all languages, though, Italian too loves to be creative. According to the context in which you find yourself or your confidence with the language, here are a few alternatives to the classical “Mi piace/piacciono…”:</p><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table class=has-fixed-layout><tbody readability=16.5><tr><td><strong>Alternatives to </strong><strong>mi piace</strong></td><td><strong>EN translation</strong></td><td><strong>Context</strong></td></tr><tr readability=9.5><td>Non mi dispiace…</td><td>I don’t mind (something)…</td><td readability=6>You are not crazy about something, but you can work with it. Usually, you would expect a ‘but’ as a follow-up.<p>Non mi è dispiaciuto l’ultimo album di Eros Ramazzotti.&nbsp;<br>I didn’t mind the last Eros Ramazzotti’s album</p></td></tr><tr readability=6.5><td>Non è male…</td><td>It’s not bad…</td><td readability=6>Similar to the example above, you would expect some sort of opinion or criticism after.<p>Non è male, ma aggiungerei del sale.<br>It’s not bad but I’d add a pinch of salt.</p></td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Che bello! Che figo!</td><td>How cool!</td><td readability=7>Both are expressions of excitement and enjoyment and they can also be used to compliment something/someone.<p>Che figo/bello quel maglione!<br>Your sweater is really cool!</p><p>These alternatives would be mainly used in very informal contexts.</p></td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Lo/le/gli amo/adoro&nbsp;</td><td>To love or adore something/something</td><td readability=5>We go back using verbs and we move up a bit on the liking scale. In Italian too you can love (amo) or adore (adoro) something.<p>Adoro imparare le lingue straniere!<br>I adore learning foreign languages.</p></td></tr><tr readability=8><td>Vado pazzo/matto per… (sing)Vanno pazzi/matti per… (pl)</td><td>I am crazy for/I go nuts for..</td><td readability=5>Another informal way of expressing your unconditional love for something. So much so it makes you go crazy.<p>Vanno pazzi per il tiramisù.<br>They are crazy for tiramisù.</p></td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Mi fa/fanno morire.</td><td>Lit. They make me die…</td><td readability=5>Used in informal contexts, this is quite a usual way of declaring that something is so good for you that it makes you die!<p>Il suo sorriso mi fa morire.<br>Her smile makes me die.</p></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Like it or not</h2><p>Ti è piaciuto questo articolo?
