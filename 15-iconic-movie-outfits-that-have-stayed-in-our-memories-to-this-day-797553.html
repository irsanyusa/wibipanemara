It&nbsp;is&nbsp;impossible to&nbsp;imagine our lives without <a href=# title=movies data-link=tag>movies</a>. Thanks to&nbsp;them, our world has been filled with memorable scenes and lines that are part of&nbsp;our daily lives. And not only that: movies have also left&nbsp;us with clothes that have become emblematic in&nbsp;pop culture, and some of&nbsp;them have even became <a href=# title=fashionable data-link=tag>fashionable</a> garments for everyday use.</p><p><strong>Bright Side</strong> prepared a&nbsp;list of&nbsp;15&nbsp;garments that the world of&nbsp;cinema made famous and that, surely, all of&nbsp;our readers will recognize in&nbsp;a&nbsp;split second.</p><p><h2>1. Bruce Lee’s yellow suit</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a95/c54/67d76c5e2180ca07859c91f8c8.jpg><p>The yellow suit worn by&nbsp;<a href=#>Uma Thurman</a> in&nbsp;<a href=#>Kill Bill Volume&nbsp;1</a>, which has become a&nbsp;movie icon, is&nbsp;actually an&nbsp;homage to&nbsp;<a href=#>Bruce Lee</a>, who wore a&nbsp;similar suit in&nbsp;Game of&nbsp;Death, the <a href=#>movie</a> that the martial arts icon was filming when he&nbsp;tragically passed away. Since the audience of&nbsp;Lee’s film was much smaller than that of&nbsp;<a href=#>Tarantino</a>’s, the movie did not achieve the accolades (either in&nbsp;terms of&nbsp;criticism or&nbsp;audience numbers) that Kill Bill obtained around the world&nbsp;— we&nbsp;can therefore say that the yellow suit became an&nbsp;icon thanks to&nbsp;Kill Bill.</p><p><h2>2. The Blues Brothers’ suit, hat, and sunglasses</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4ee/37b/7592135715a3ebd35d0035db8a.jpg><p>In&nbsp;1980, the film by&nbsp;the comic and musical duo <a href=#>The Blues Brothers</a>, portrayed by&nbsp;<a href=#>John Belushi</a> and <a href=#>Dan Aykroyd</a>, began the journey that would turn it&nbsp;into a&nbsp;cult film. John and Dan wore outfits that, for that time, were considered outdated. However, by&nbsp;adding the dark glasses and their crazy, rebellious imprint, they made it&nbsp;part of&nbsp;the modern rock world. We&nbsp;are of&nbsp;course referring to&nbsp;the black suit, the hat, and the dark glasses, which are now considered a&nbsp;classic.</p><p><h2>3. A&nbsp;Clockwork Orange’s suspender pants</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b18/878/f408615395a38832ff3cab3140.jpg><p>Directed by&nbsp;<a href=#>Stanley Kubrick</a> and released in&nbsp;1971, <a href=#>A&nbsp;Clockwork Orange</a> generated controversy for its violent scenes. The movie certainly generated a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;social criticism, especially among young audiences. The suspender pants, the hat, and the boots became a&nbsp;reference of&nbsp;the world’s countercultural movements.</p><p><h2>4. The Flashdance sweatshirt</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c0d/ed2/3a6f9056368dfea4816e6baa50.jpg><p><a href=#>Flashdance</a> tells the story of&nbsp;a&nbsp;young working-class woman whose dream was to&nbsp;become a&nbsp;dancer. The film became a&nbsp;success both because of&nbsp;the great music and because of&nbsp;the love story that the protagonist had with the owner of&nbsp;the factory where she worked. <a href=#>Jennifer Beals</a>’ shoulder-revealing sweatshirt became popular among young women and teenagers of&nbsp;the time, so&nbsp;much so&nbsp;that it&nbsp;became an&nbsp;enduring trend.</p><p><h2>5. John Travolta’s white suit in&nbsp;Saturday Night Fever</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2cd/4b2/205d83591c85755cb4b5b9f09e.jpg><p>The ’70s were the years of&nbsp;disco music, and <a href=#>Saturday Night Fever</a>&nbsp;is, without a&nbsp;doubt, the best example of&nbsp;that trend. The movie was full of&nbsp;love, rebellion, social criticism and, above all, lots of&nbsp;great music and dancing. The soundtrack included some of&nbsp;the most famous songs of&nbsp;the <a href=#>Bee Gees</a>. The dance scene in&nbsp;which <a href=#>John Travolta</a> wears a&nbsp;white suit with a&nbsp;black shirt, made that outfit an&nbsp;icon and a&nbsp;reference to&nbsp;those years.</p><p><h2>6. The Ghostbusters’ costume</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/824/c53/e68bfa5a4e90b125cb5bc71f01.jpg><p>One of&nbsp;the great successes of&nbsp;the 1980s was <a href=#>Ghostbusters</a>, which was co-scripted by&nbsp;one of&nbsp;its protagonists, Dan Aykroyd, who we&nbsp;mentioned before was a&nbsp;member of&nbsp;The Blues Brothers. The film’s theme song became a&nbsp;pop hit and the garments worn by&nbsp;the Ghostbusters became popular too. The team’s logo, with the ghost crossed out by&nbsp;the red stripe became so&nbsp;popular that young people wore it&nbsp;on&nbsp;T-shirts and sweatshirts.</p><p><h2>7. Top Gun’s jacket</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7fb/403/c00c7e59ccad6035490cc8ba88.jpg><p>Another 80s classic, <a href=#>Top Gun</a>, the movie that launched <a href=#>Tom Cruise</a> to&nbsp;fame and glory, was a&nbsp;total blockbuster in&nbsp;its day. One of&nbsp;the songs on&nbsp;the soundtrack, “<a href=#>Take My&nbsp;Breath Away</a>,” by&nbsp;Berlin, became one of&nbsp;the most famous slow beats of&nbsp;the decade and, together with the film, they both became classics. <a href=# title="Tom Cruise" data-link=tag>Tom Cruise</a>’s character turned his sunglasses and jacket into a&nbsp;legendary outfit.</p><p><h2>8. Humphrey Bogart’s trench coat and hat from Casablanca</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/55f/e50/cb0d6550919cd5feb7811339bb.jpg><p><a href=#>Casablanca</a> is&nbsp;undoubtedly one of&nbsp;the greatest classics of&nbsp;all time, and it&nbsp;is&nbsp;not possible to&nbsp;talk about the history of&nbsp;cinema without mentioning&nbsp;it. It&nbsp;left&nbsp;us with memorable scenes, quotes that we&nbsp;have all heard a&nbsp;thousand times, like, “We&nbsp;will always have Paris,” or&nbsp;“I&nbsp;think this is&nbsp;the beginning of&nbsp;a&nbsp;beautiful friendship,” and “Play it, Sam. Play ’As Time Goes By’.” And that’s not all: <a href=#>Humphrey Bogart</a>’s trench coat and hat have become one with him: it’s very difficult to&nbsp;think of&nbsp;those clothes without the image of&nbsp;the actor coming to&nbsp;mind.</p><p><h2>9. Marlon Brando’s tank from A&nbsp;Streetcar Named Desire</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ef8/fa8/d55d3d55a09ba4c5de7944ecab.jpg><p>A&nbsp;<a href=#>Streetcar Named Desire</a>, based on&nbsp;a&nbsp;play by&nbsp;<a href=#>Tennessee Williams</a>, is&nbsp;another classic of&nbsp;film history. <a href=#>Marlon Brando</a>, its protagonist, was launched to&nbsp;fame wearing this simple yet iconic attire. Brando’s incredible display of&nbsp;sensitive masculinity was perfectly portrayed by&nbsp;his strong arms and delicate hands.</p><p><h2>10. Marilyn Monroe’s white dress in&nbsp;The Seven Year Itch</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/31a/a5b/332dcc533682d3889943e76487.jpg><p><a href=#>Marilyn Monroe</a> is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the most iconic women in&nbsp;the history of&nbsp;cinema. Beyond her talent as&nbsp;an&nbsp;actress, her image has marked an&nbsp;era. The slim, sophisticated figure that Hollywood was used to&nbsp;seeing via its female stars, changed forever after Marilyn. It’s impossible to&nbsp;speak of&nbsp;her without remembering the famous scene from <a href=#>The Seven Year Itch</a>, in&nbsp;which her white dress was lifted up&nbsp;and left her legs exposed. It’s perhaps one of&nbsp;the most iconic scenes in&nbsp;the history of&nbsp;cinema.</p><p><h2>11. Brad Pitt’s leather jacket from Fight Club</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/82d/047/3759085b1aa6a489738d07afaf.jpg><p><a href=#>Fight Club</a> told a&nbsp;strange, violent story, full of&nbsp;black humor and disenchantment. At&nbsp;the time, it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;success and, over the years, it&nbsp;earned the status of&nbsp;modern classic. <a href=#>Brad Pitt</a>’s character was a&nbsp;symbol of&nbsp;leadership, sensuality, audacity, and rebellion. Choosing the wardrobe for this character could have been a&nbsp;challenge for designers, but they clearly rose to&nbsp;the occasion, making the jacket he&nbsp;was wearing an&nbsp;iconic piece.</p><p><h2>12. Susan Sarandon’s handkerchief and sunglasses from Thelma and Louise</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ed5/11c/4b7e4f5da5be7c68408609f1b5.jpg><p>Directed by&nbsp;<a href=#>Ridley Scott</a>, <a href=#>Thelma &&nbsp;Louise</a> was one of&nbsp;the great successes of&nbsp;the 1990s. The film was considered an&nbsp;important symbol, and many women saw in&nbsp;the protagonists the representation of&nbsp;a&nbsp;new type of&nbsp;woman who rebelled against submission and brutality. Interpretations aside, the fact is&nbsp;that both characters became icons of&nbsp;the cinema, and Louise’s scarf and glasses earned their place in&nbsp;our list.</p><p><h2>13. Princess Leia’s dress from Star Wars: Episode IV&nbsp;— A&nbsp;New Hope</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/747/59c/e1acec5c91a2e1a5b490096c92.jpg><p>Of&nbsp;course, this list could not leave out this classic outfit. <a href=#>Princess Leia</a>, played by&nbsp;<a href=#>Carrie Fisher</a>, is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the most beloved and remembered characters of&nbsp;<a href=#>this</a> sci-fi classic. Her particular hairstyle and her white dress, are without a&nbsp;doubt, true modern symbols.</p><p><h2>14. The Joker’s purple suit from Batman: The Dark Knight</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7a0/5ca/339a835ec2a47baab2d9d0fa19.jpg><p>For many people, <a href=#>The Dark Knight</a> is&nbsp;the best Batman movie of&nbsp;all time, and truth to&nbsp;be&nbsp;told, it&nbsp;does score <a href=#>9.0</a>&nbsp;on IMDb. It’s actually one of&nbsp;the top rated movies on&nbsp;the site. But let’s not forget that the Joker, played by&nbsp;<a href=#>Heath Ledger</a>, was just as&nbsp;important as&nbsp;Batman in&nbsp;this movie. His performance was brilliant and earned him a&nbsp;posthumous Oscar in&nbsp;the Best Supporting Actor category. The character’s insane costume is&nbsp;undoubtedly another icon of&nbsp;cinema and pop culture.</p><p><h2>15. Nastassja Kinski’s dress from Paris, Texas</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/736/38c/657c0e5e228b25eca5f9a3ada4.jpg><p>Written by&nbsp;<a href=#>Sam Sheppard</a> and directed by&nbsp;<a href=#>Win Wenders</a>, <a href=#>Paris, Texas</a> is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the greatest films in&nbsp;the history of&nbsp;cinema. Deep and ascetic, the story of&nbsp;“Travis,” a&nbsp;strange man who is&nbsp;first seen lost in&nbsp;the desert after having spent years away from his family, is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the great classics of&nbsp;world cinema. The dress worn by&nbsp;<a href=#>Nastassja Kinski</a> in&nbsp;the heartbreaking closing scene is&nbsp;an&nbsp;icon of&nbsp;the world of&nbsp;cinema, especially for film lovers all around the world.</p><p>Which of&nbsp;these outfits is&nbsp;the most iconic in&nbsp;pop culture, according to&nbsp;you? Have you worn any of&nbsp;them to&nbsp;a&nbsp;costume party? Do&nbsp;you have a&nbsp;photo to&nbsp;share with&nbsp;us? Share your thoughts and pictures in&nbsp;the comments!</p><p>“Top Gun: Maverick,” the sequel to&nbsp;the 1986&nbsp;classic, showcases Tom Cruise’s <a href=#>dedication to&nbsp;realism</a> in&nbsp;cinema. Eschewing CGI, Cruise insisted on&nbsp;using real jets for filming, capturing the genuine distortions of&nbsp;the face produced by&nbsp;gravity. The production involved approximately 800 hours of&nbsp;footage, with actors undergoing rigorous training to&nbsp;handle the physical demands of&nbsp;aerial stunts. Cruise’s commitment was evident as&nbsp;he&nbsp;even flew some of&nbsp;the planes himself. The film, while capturing the essence of&nbsp;the original, introduced innovative filming techniques, making it&nbsp;a&nbsp;cinematic marvel.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH52ecicpqehk2K6sMLInmSoraSbtrW%2FjK2fmqxdna63sYysq5qxlZl6qrqMqKyrZZ2aurC%2ByJ6qZqyfYsGptdJmm5qxXWyGeIGUbGY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kevin-hart-actor-gets-sweaty-and-shirtless-in-las-vegas.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Actor gets sweaty and shirtless in Las Vegas</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./uk-global-screen-fund-rishi-sunak-1234840054.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>U.K. Creates Global Screen Fund to Replace Creative Europe MEDIA Funding After Brexit</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./joe-biden-immigration-private-prisons.html>Biden Use of Private Migrant Centers Grows Amid Border Surge</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-often-should-you-replace-your-shoes.html>How Often Should You Replace Your Shoes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1550102-james-bond-actors-order-how-played-iconic-spy.html>James Bond actors in order: how many played the iconic spy?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./0-28804-1898067-1938106-1938103-00-html.html>Jeff Han - TIME 100 Roundtables</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-cnsa-adopte-sa-convention-socle-avec-les-departements.html>La CNSA adopte sa convention socle avec les dpartements</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogZ.
